<h2>Preface.</h2>


<p>War is a hard, stern teacher, and its lessons are bitter in the learning;
yet some of its teaching we badly needed—and not the least important of
its many lessons is the one it inculcated on the criminality of waste.</p>

<p>To so many of us “waste” was a word with a comparative meaning.
What was waste in one woman was not necessarily waste in another, we
argued. It was wrong for the factory girl to let her skirts drop off her for
lack of mending; but not wrong for better-off women to discard their
clothes directly they showed the least sign of wear, because they could afford
to buy more, we said; and, besides, it made it good for trade—that was a
favourite argument used by the extravagant to excuse their wanton waste.</p>

<p>But we have all learnt the value of economy of recent years: and we
have seen how the saving and thrift of individuals may mean the salvation
of the State. It will be a long time before we can ever return to that
condition of easy-going plenty that we knew before the war. In any case
the cost of all commodities will remain higher in price. The woman who
can utilize oddments and make things with her own hands is the woman
who will be making money, as she will be supplying one of the most
expensive items of modern times—personal labour. The hints in this book
are intended as suggestions, which can be developed in many new directions.</p>

<h2>The Brassiere.</h2>


<p>The Brassiere, or bust bodice, is an
essential garment for those who wish
to keep the form neat in appearance
now when the low cut corset is so
much in vogue. It has the great
advantage of correcting round
shoulders in those who are inclined
to stoop when walking, and prevents
that ugly ridge so often seen in the
back of the coat or blouse caused
by the top of the corset.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 430px;">

<div class="caption">The Crochet Trimming gives a pretty finish.</div>
</div>

<p>They are so very easily made that
every woman and girl should make
as many as she requires, for they are
expensive articles to buy, and the
garments one makes for one’s self
are likely to outlast three or four of
the bought kind and this, too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
at about one-third the cost.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 405px;">
<img src="images/i012.jpg" width="405" height="398" alt="Beautiful inset crocheted lace and roses" />
<div class="caption">This Section of the Front shows the actual size of the Crochet.</div>
</div>

<p>The pattern for the Brassiere shown
here is in three parts, the front, side-front
and back. Half a yard of 36
inch wide linen or cambric is sufficient.
The material used must be
strong but fine, and linen is, of
course, the best for wearing qualities.</p>

<p>Having cut out the sections, join
all seams with a row of stitching less
than a quarter of an inch from the
edge, open out the seams flat and
cover each with a casing made by a
strip of the linen with the edge
turned inwards, each should then be
half an inch wide. Stitch close to
the edge at each side. The three
centre casings have buttonholes
worked in the centre of the casing,
in an upward direction, each an inch
in length. These are to admit of a
strip of whalebone, eight inches in
length and which can readily be
removed for washing.</p>

<p>Turn in a narrow hem at each side
of the shoulder section and stitch in
place. Make the insertion and place
in position on the front, mark the
lines at each side, cut the material
along the centre where the various
strips are to be, turn in a narrow hem
and stitch all round. Then turn a
hem all round the edge and stitch.</p>

<div class="sidenote">With an Irish Crochet
Insertion.</div>

<p>With the crochet hook, put a row
of 8 ch 1 d&nbsp;c into the edge of the hem
from the lower edge of the back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
round to the opposite point and
around each armhole. Into each
loop put 7 ch 1 d&nbsp;c twice, with 5 ch
1 d&nbsp;c from loop to loop.</p>

<p>Sew a patent fastener to the top
edge of the back, and a long strip of
tape to the lower edge. The tapes
are crossed at the back and brought
round to the front to regulate the fit
of the brassiere.</p>


<div class='sub'><b>The Insertion.</b></div>

<p>This is the pretty Rose beading in
Irish crochet, and is made with
Manlove’s Irish lace thread, No. 50,
with a No. 6 crochet hook.</p>

<p>Form 6 ch into a ring.</p>

<p><i>8th Row.</i>—Turn with 8 ch and
repeat the 4 picot loops as in last row,
for 8 rows of the 4 loops.</p>

<p><i>16th Row.</i>—Turn with 5 ch, 1 tr

Then repeat the 16th and 17th rows
and form 8 rows more of the picot
loops.</p>

<p>Make another rose and join to the
picot loops in the last row to correspond
with the joining of the first
one.</p>

<p>When the front strip is of sufficient
length, make the strip for each
shoulder and the front piece, joining
each to the loops in the straight
strip.</p>

<p>Make the straightening rows at each
side with 1 tr 2 ch into each loop and
petal along the sides, placing the trs
so that the chs may form a straight
line.</p>

<p>Work a 2nd row of 2 ch 1 tr into
each space of 1st row, then finish
with 3 d&nbsp;c into each space.</p>

<p>Now top-sew the insertion in place
and join the shoulders with a flat

<h2>A Camisole Yoke of Embroidered
Filet Net and Crochet.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 172px;">
<img src="images/i014a.jpg" width="172" height="143" alt="photo of yoke" />
<div class="caption">From this diagram the Shamrock Design can be worked in darning.</div>
</div>
<p>Machine-made filet
net was used in making
this pretty yoke,
on which the trefoil
is worked in darning
stitch with Tenax
embroidery silk
in a moss-rose
shade of pink. Other
lovely shades can be
had in the Tenax
silk, and blue,
green, or mauve will
answer quite as well. The shape
is cut out from the net, allowing two
meshes for a margin at all edges.</p>


<p>Using No. 70 Peri-Lusta crochet
cotton, overcast the two rows of
meshes left as a margin with an
overcasting through each mesh, then
with a No. 5 crochet
hook work a row of
d c all round the edges,
2 d&nbsp;c into each mesh.</p>

<p>Around the edge of
the sleeve part, neck,
and fronts of the yoke,
work a row of 9 ch
loops, 1 into every
4th d&nbsp;c.</p>

<p>Then into each loop
put 7 ch 1 d&nbsp;c twice.</p>

<p>The trefoil is then
worked in simple darning stitch.
Have the wrong side turned towards
you while doing the embroidery, as
all fastenings of the thread must be
made on this side.</p>

<p>The trefoil can readily be copied
from the diagram.</p>

</div>



<p>Place the stocking
as shown in Fig.
1, cut off the
sole at the
dotted line a—b; then cut off the
toe at the line c—d. As the heel
of the sole piece will not lie flat it
must be slit, until, when laid out,
it resembles fig. 2. Cut pieces to
these patterns from the leg of
another stocking, allowing turnings
as follows:</p>

<p>Fig. 1, the toe piece, ½-inch at c—d
where it joins the stocking; fig. 2.
½-inch all round except at the lines
a—b, c—b, where ¼-inch only must
be allowed. If
the stocking is
short this can be
remedied by
leaving the extra
length required
at fig. 1, a, and
fig. 2, d, in addition
to the
turnings previously mentioned.</p>

<p>Machine the new toe piece to the
stocking at c—d (fig. 1), open and
press the seam. Machine a—b to b—c,
of the sole piece (fig. 2), open and
press the seam. Machine this new
sole to the stocking, open and press
the seam. Fasten down all seams
with small slip stitches.</p>

<p>It is advisable to use mercerised
cotton or silk, and to leave the tension
of the machine rather slack.</p>

<h2>Three Pretty Aprons.</h2>


<p>In a Christmas
parcel
sent to me
from Italy
this year,
I found
two of the
dearest
little
aprons I
have ever
seen—much
less
owned.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 267px;">
<img src="images/i017.jpg" width="267" height="421" alt="full short apron with embroidery around neck and hem with waistband held iwth decorative button in front" />
<div class="caption"><p>AN EASILY SLIPPED-ON APRON.</p></div>
</div>

<p>They
were so
very unusual
and yet
so simple
of make,
that I feel
every girl
who is
fond of
aprons
would love
to have
one. To
these two I
have added
one other,
equally simple, and which costs but
a few pence all told.</p>


<p class='sub'>An Easily-Slipped-on
Apron.</p>

<p>The first one of the three is one of
the Italian ones, and is made of two
yards of ordinary kitchen roller
towel. This particular one is made
from unbleached linen, utterly free
from coloured stripes or borders.</p>

<p>From a two yard length of towelling,
cut off a strip ten inches long,
which will be used for the waistband.</p>

<p>At one end
of the long
length
make a
three inch
hem, this
being the
front.</p>

<p>Now lay
this strip
on the
table, and
measuring
39 inches
from the
hem, make
a dot with
a lead pencil,
and
take this
dot as the
centre of a
circle 33
inches in
circumference,
which also
mark out
with the
pencil with
the help of
a compass. Next cut out this circle
and neatly turn in the raw edge,
making a tiny hem. At the back of
the apron, that is the end unhemmed,
make three pleats—one box pleat in
the centre and two outward turning
ones on either side of the centre
pleat.</p>

<p>Cut the ten inch strip into two
5 inch ones, and join in the middle
to form a long band. Fold this
neatly in the middle and point one
end, letting the other end be straight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>Join to the back of the apron and
stitch on firmly by machine. Put a
fastening in the form of a button and
button-hole, or hook and eye, or
patent fastener, on each end of the
belt, to complete the apron.</p>

<p>Slip the head through the circular
opening and let the apron fall on to
the shoulders, and join the waistband
in the front, and there you have the
simplest and quickest made apron
one could possibly imagine.</p>

<p>The decoration on my little apron
consists of a design of three conventional
red roses with green leaves
and stalk, separated by 5 graduated
dots, the largest being in the middle.
This occurs across the foot of the
apron, about half an inch from the
front hem, and again around the
neck, but three inches from the edge
of the circle. Right round the circle
is a line of stitching in brown silk,
then a row of green French knots,
and then another line of brown,
making a narrow band.</p>

<p>In the centre of the belt is a large
button covered in linen, and a single
red rose, minus the stalk, worked
on it.</p>


<p class='sub'>An Apron with
Smocking.</p>


<p>The second apron is also Italian,
but this one is more suitable for
needlework or knitting, when one’s
frock is apt to pick up pieces of
thread or fluff from the wool. It is
easily made from a piece of white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
alpaca, 22 inches
long by 27 inches
wide. A straight
piece of material
is used, and the
edges are scalloped
in three inch wide
scallops. Down
both sides and
along the bottom
there is embroidered
in white silk,
a design of leaves,
with a centre
flower worked in
Richelieu openwork,
and the
effect of this on
the alpaca is really
very beautiful.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 416px;">
<img src="images/i018.jpg" width="416" height="356" alt="half-apron with beautiful eyelet insets and scalloped edges" />
<div class="caption">AN APRON WITH SMOCKING AND RICHELIEU EMBROIDERY.</div>
</div>

<p>At the top the
apron is narrowed
by means of three
groups of honeycomb
or diamond
smocking, terminating
in points. A
tiny pocket on the
right hand side
has also a little smocking at the base
to correspond. This pocket is made
from a 6 inch square of the material
and is fastened to the apron by means
of feather-stitching.</p>

<p>The band consists of a piece of
alpaca, one yard long and about an
inch wide. This band is stitched all
around by machine.</p>


<p class='sub'>A Pleated Work
Apron.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 183px;">
<img src="images/i019.jpg" width="183" height="397" alt="unusual looking apron, full, with long pointed skirt in front made of gingham" />
<div class="caption">A PLEATED APRON.</div>
</div>

<p>Last of all comes the little odd
apron, but I should not be at all
surprised if many of you did not
prefer it to either of the others.</p>

<p>For this, one yard of zephyr is
needed in a pretty check or plaid
design, and a quarter of a yard of
plain zephyr to
match or tone in
colour. One of the
many that I have
made was of white
zephyr, with a
plaid design of
pale blue and
brown. To go with
this I chose a plain
chocolate brown,
and it really looked
exceedingly pretty
when finished.</p>

<p>From the yard
of check material
cut a strip three
inches wide along
the selvedge. Then
from the remaining
piece, cut a
strip six inches
wide on the width
of the material.
This will leave a
piece 27 inches
wide and 30 long.
Most zephyrs run
30 inches wide in
the single width.</p>

<p>Lay the material flat on the table
and turn down a narrow hem, where
the selvedge has been cut off, also
making a hem the selvedge side as
well. Then take two corners of the
square and join them together to
form a mitre, being very careful to
match the design of the material.
This forms a pocket, which is useful
for holding anything. Next cut the
plain material into three strips of 3
inches each, and join into one long
piece. Then the 6 inch piece of
checked zephyr should be cut into
two pieces, each measuring 3 inches
wide, and also joined into one long
strip.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>This leaves you with one long strip
of plain, one middle-sized piece of
check, and one shorter strip of check.</p>

<p>Take the short piece of check,
which measures just a yard long, and
cut off a piece of plain one inch
shorter. Lay the plain material on
top of the check, and tack them
together with a line of thread down
the centre. Fold the check material
over the plain to form a narrow
border either side, and stitch with
machine. Leave one end of this
band rough, and the other end round
off, continuing the little border the
same as the sides.</p>

<p>From the 60-inch strip of check,
cut off a yard length, and the same
from the plain, proceeding exactly as
before, only finishing off one end
quite straight. This makes the
shoulder straps and band of the
apron, and should leave two strips
of material, one check measuring 24
inches and one plain measuring 18
inches. This latter cut into two
strips one-and-a-half inches wide, and
join into one strip again. Turn down
either side of this strip to make a
band, and sew along the top edge of
the pocket, slanting each end to
make a pretty finish.</p>

<p>When this is done, take a stitch
with a needle through the centre of
the pocket and the apron, and this
prevents it from gaping.</p>

<p>Take the top of the apron next and
lay in twelve half inch tucks, six
going one way and six the reverse,
but both facing in towards the centre
of the apron. Before doing this,
turn down the rough edge to make a
neat heading. Sew on the two straps
at either end of the top. From the
remaining piece of zephyr, cut a
strip one-and-a-half inches wide and
the length of the top of the apron
bib. Turn in each side and both
ends, and stitch across the bib top to
cover the straps.</p>

<p>To finish the apron, work a buttonhole
in the rounded end of one of
the strings, and sew a button on the
other strap. Then take an iron and
pleat the whole apron from top to
bottom in half-inch pleats, using the
stitched pleats of the bib as a guide.</p>

<p>When wearing the apron the straps
should go over the shoulders and
cross at the back, and come round
the waist and button in the centre
front.</p>

<p>The description of this apron may
sound a little difficult, but it is really
simplicity itself, and very quickly
made, besides being very inexpensive.</p>

<h2>Utilizing Partly-Worn Garments.</h2>


<p>Garments are often discarded as
being of no use, just because they are
worn in certain parts, whereas a little
thought and careful cutting will often
transform them into something quite
useful. It is often possible, for instance,
to make garments for the little
ones by using the least worn portions
of larger sized clothes. Partly worn
woollen vests can be admirably
re-made into babies’ pants.</p>

<p>To make these take the old vest
and cut along the line A B, shown on
the little diagram. This cuts away
the most worn part of the garment.
Curve out at the bottom,
along the lines C D and
E F.</p>

<p>The stitches required
in the little garments are
very simple. Join by
seaming together the
edges from D to E. Turn
down a fold of about
½-inch round the curved
portions, and herringbone
or machine-stitch.
At the top, turn down a
hem of 1 inch, and stitch
in the same way. Make
two eyelet holes in the
back of this, and insert
a draw-string. A cosy
little garment for baby
is the result.</p>

<p class='sub'>A Use for Old
Stockings.</p>

<p>A delightfully warm
pair of bloomers for a
little girl of 5 or 6 can be made
from the legs of winter stockings,
the feet of which are too worn
for further mending. Two pairs
are needed. First cut off the
legs just above the darns on the
heel, then cut up the back seam
and lay them open. Now lay
your pattern on, and you will
probably find that you can just
cut the four pieces, bearing in
mind that the stocking will stretch,
so can be cut considerably narrower
than ordinary material.
When the seams are machined
up (once stitching is
quite sufficient), and a
hem, wide enough
for elastic to be run in,
made at the waist and
bottom of the legs, you
have as comfortable and
cosy a garment as you
could wish for. If the
legs of the stockings are
hardly wide enough for
your pattern, corners
can easily be cut from
the ankle or front of the
foot, and joined on to
each piece. This sounds
very lumpy, but the
seams can be machined
quite narrow (you find
they don’t fray out at
all), and being of wool
are perfectly soft, and
will not be noticed in
the wearing.</p>

<div class="caption">A COLLAR WITH LITTLE SHAPING.</div>
</div>

<p>Furs are a very expensive
item at the best of times, and
increasingly so just now. Yet
some additional warmth at the
throat and neck is very necessary
in the cold weather.
The difficulty is admirably
settled in the collars here
shown. Besides being warmer,
they are a change from an
ordinary scarf, and with a
careful choice of colour, can give a
very stylish finish to any coat.</p>


<p class='sub'>A Collar with
very little shaping.</p>

<p>This nicely fitting collar is worked
in plain knitting with very little
shaping, and is afterwards given a
fur-like appearance by means of a

<p class='sub'><small>Materials required.</small></p>

<p>3 oz. Teazle Wool. Two No. 8
Celluloid Knitting Needles. A large
button mould. Two or three dress-fasteners.</p>

<p><i>13th Row.</i>—K 10, lift up the stitch
before the next and knit it together

<p><i>14th Row.</i>—K 15.</p>

<p>Continue in this manner, knitting
in 5 extra stitches every alternate
row, until all the 45 stitches are on
one row again *.</p>

<p>Knit without shaping until the

<p>3½ oz. Teazle Wool. Two No. 8
Celluloid Knitting Needles. A large
button mould. Two or three dress-fasteners.</p>

<p>This Collar should be worked at a
tension to produce about 6 stitches
and 12 rows to the inch.</p>

<p>Commencing along the lower edge
at the back of the collar, cast on 126

<p>Knitting plain, decrease once at
the beginning and end of every 12th
row until 4 stitches have been
decreased at each side (leaving 118
stitches in the row).</p>

<p>Then increase once at the beginning

<p>Knit to within 5 stitches from the

turn and knit back.</p>

<p>* Knit to within 5 stitches of the
end of the last row, turn and knit
back. Repeat from * until only 5
stitches remain in the last short row.</p>

<p>In the next row the stitches require
to be all knitted into one row again,
but to prevent little holes from
appearing at the turnings of the

should be lifted up and knitted
together with the next stitch above
the turning.</p>

<p>Knit 8 rows without shaping.

<h2>To Freshen a Last Season’s Jersey.</h2>


<p>It is always the neck and wrist
edges that show the first signs of
wear on a knitted sports coat or
jersey, and often a garment
is discarded as done for
just because these
parts are shabby
or out-of-date.</p>

<p>Have you
ever thought
of knitting
an entirely
fresh set of
collar and
cuffs to replace
the
soiled parts,
or to be
added to a
collarless
jersey or
coat? The
existing collar and cuffs can quite
easily be cut away and the raw
edges neatly buttonholed with
wool before sewing on the new set.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 268px;">
<img src="images/i024.jpg" width="268" height="268" alt="photo of cut jersey" />
</div>

<p>You will probably not be successful
in getting wool the exact colour
of your jersey, so it will be best to
use a striking contrast, such as purple
on a pale blue jersey, or emerald
green on a white one; or if you
already have two colours in the
jersey, or it is of a specially brightly-hued
tint, black makes a pleasing
contrast. And this year particularly
contrasts of colour are very much in
vogue, so that your re-modelled
jersey will be quite fashionable.</p>

<p>Here is a practical little set that
you will find quite easy to make.</p>


<p class='sub'>The Collar.</p>

<p>This is of the ever-popular sailor
shape that will be quite easily adapted
to most garments.</p>

<p>“Sirdar” Sports Wool has been
used for the making on No. 9 bone
needles; or a 5-ply “Sirdar”
Scotch Fingering would
work up at a similar
tension. Three
ounces of wool will
be sufficient for
the set.</p>

<p class='sub'><small>Abbreviations
Used.</small></p>

<p>K = knit;
P = purl;
N = narrow
(k two st together);
st =

<p>Commence

and cast on
78 st.</p>

<p>K 17 rows plain.</p>

<p><i>18th Row.</i>—K 8, P to 8 st from the

<p><i>19th Row.</i>—Knit plain.</p>

<p>Repeat the 18th and 19th rows
twice.</p>

<p><i>24th Row.</i>—K 8, P 4, * K 6, P 6,
repeat from * 3 times, K 6, P 4, K 8.</p>

<p><i>25th Row</i>—K 12, * P 6, K 6, repeat
from * 3 times, P 6, K 12.</p>

<p>Repeat the 24th and 25th rows
once.</p>

<p><i>28th Row.</i>—K 8, P 10, * K 6, P 6,
repeat from * twice, K 6, P 10, K 8.</p>

<p><i>29th Row.</i>—K 18, * P 6, K 6, repeat
from * twice, P 6, K 18.</p>

<p>Repeat the 28th and 29th rows
once.</p>

<p>Repeat from the 24th row once,
and then from the 24th to the 27th
row once. This completes the
pattern.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Other Ways of
Renovating.</div>
<p>K 24 rows a plain and a purl row<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
alternately, always working the 8
border st plain in <i>every</i> row.</p>

<p>Now to divide for the neck: K 34,
and slip these st on to a safety-pin.
Cast off 14 st for the centre of the
neck, and on the remaining 34 st
knit up the left front of the collar
thus: Work 10 rows a plain and a
purl row alternately, knitting the
2nd and 3rd st together of every row
turned from the neck edge, and
continuing the 8 plain border st.</p>

<p>Continue shaping in this way,
decreasing also at the border side by
purling the 10th and 11th st together
of every 4th row turned from
the border edge.</p>

<p>When you have worked off all but
the 8 border st continue in plain
knitting, decreasing from the neck
edge only, until only 3 st remain.</p>

<p>Reverse the directions for the right
side of collar.</p>

<p>Now pick up all the loops from the
neck edge and K 6 plain rows.</p>


<p class='sub'>The Cuffs.</p>

<p>Cast on 50 st.</p>

<p>K 13 rows plain.</p>

<p><i>14th Row.</i>—K 6, P to 6 st from the

<p><i>15th Row.</i>—Plain.</p>

<p>Repeat the 14th and 15th rows once.</p>

<p><i>18th Row.</i>—K 6, P 4, K 6, P 6,
K 6, P 6, K 6, P 4, K 6.</p>

<p><i>19th Row.</i>—K 10, P 6, K 6, P 6,

<p><i>22nd Row.</i>—K 6, P 10, K 6, P 6,
K 6, P 10, K 6.</p>

<p><i>23rd Row.</i>—K 16, P 6, K 6, P 6,
K 16.</p>

<p>Repeat the 22nd and 23rd rows
once.</p>

<p>Repeat from the 16th row to the
19th row once. This completes the
pattern.</p>

<p>K 16 rows a plain and a purl row
alternately, working the 6 border st
plain in <i>every</i> row.</p>

<p>K 6 plain rows, cast off.</p>


<p class='sub'>For a Collarless
Coat.</p>

<p>Another simple way of freshening
the neck of a collarless jersey coat is
to work a strip of plain knitting
4 inches wide and 12 inches long,
and stretch it along the neck edge.
Cuffs can be worked to correspond.</p>

<p>A pretty striped effect for this style
of finish can be arrived at by using
two different shades of wool, and
working first four rows of one and
then four rows of the other.</p>

<h2>The Use and Abuse of Gloves.</h2>


<p>Never be tempted to throw away a
pair of gloves, however old. That
is, until you have decided on their
utter uselessness. Because a glove
has holey fingers, or a badly torn
thumb, or a split palm, it does not
signify that it is of no use except for
house-work.</p>

<p>Our illustration will show what
can be done with gloves that are
“nearly hopeless” to most people.</p>


<p class='sub'>To Mend a Glove worn
Between the Fingers.</p>

<p>The first part to go is, as a rule,
between the fingers. This more especially
is the case with washing
gloves, which have a tendency to
shrink, and wash-leathers, unless
splice-seamed, will <i>always</i> do this.</p>

<p>As the fingers shrink, the space
between splits, and it cannot be
sewn up because it would make the
hand too tight and the fingers too
short.</p>

<p>To remedy
this,
take a
reel of
strong
thread
and a
small fur
needle
(three-sided
needle)
and make
a fine
net-work
between
the two
fingers.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 298px;">
<img src="images/i026.jpg" width="298" height="281" alt="back and front of gloves" />
<div class="caption">SHOWING THE LATTICE-WORK BETWEEN THE FINGERS,
AND ALSO HOW TO APPLY A NEW THUMB</div>
</div>

<p>Button-hole
the
edge of
the split
as you form the lattice. Insert your
needle in the edge of the hole and
make one button-hole stitch; then
take your needle into the other side
of the hole with another button-hole
stitch. Then two button-hole stitches,
and take your needle up to the top
edge of the hole, near where you
began.</p>

<p>This forms bars about 1/16-inch
apart, and with two button-hole
stitches in between.</p>

<p>This completed, turn the glove and
do the same thing across from side to
side, knotting the thread each time
it crosses the under-threads. By this
means, a tiny net-work is made.</p>

<p>This net-work is elastic, and will
wear and wash into shape and last as long
as the glove itself.</p>


<p class='sub'>Making a Neat
Patch.</p>

<p>Next to the fingers, the thumb is the
worst problem.</p>

<p>I find
that
opening
carriage
doors has
an unfortunate
knack of
splitting
a glove,
where the
thumb
joins the
palm.</p>

<p>If there
is plenty
of room,
this split
I can be
neatly
joined
up, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
the better plan is to patch it with a
tiny piece of an old glove.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Taking Care of
Your Gloves.</div>

<p>Tack the patch in, and then with
fine silk the colour of the glove,
button-hole around the edge of the
tear, taking up the under-skin as
well. This keeps it firm and neat,
and the patch may be cut away
underneath, just leaving a small
margin for stretch.</p>


<p class='sub'>Adding a New
Thumb.</p>

<p>If the top of the thumb wears out,
and is unpatchable, an entirely new
one can be put in with very little
trouble. I have an old piece of
chamois leather, which I keep for
this very thing, and it answers the
purpose beautifully.</p>

<p>Cut out the torn thumb <i>carefully</i>,
retaining the shape as much as possible.
Split up the seam and lay it flat
on the piece of leather or kid which
you are using to mend the glove.</p>

<p>Cut around the pattern, leaving a
tiny margin, as your sewing is not as
fine as that done by an expert.</p>

<p>Then tack the new thumb into the
glove around the base.</p>

<p>Button-hole this carefully in, and
lastly button-hole the seam up the
thumb and across the top. This will
be found <i>quite</i> easy.</p>

<p>For coloured kid gloves, I buy
scraps of kid from the boot maker,
and you can procure quite a nice
sized piece for a small sum, large
enough to cut any size thumb and to
leave a good few scraps for patching.</p>

<p>Always remember in putting on
gloves to proceed slowly, pulling on
the fingers first and half the palm
next, and the thumb last.</p>

<p>Be as careful in taking off as in
putting on, and pull each finger and
thumb into shape.</p>

<h2>A Knitted Hat.</h2>


<p class='sub'><small>Materials Required.</small></p>

<p>For the hat illustrated
a buckram shape
was used with the
brim slightly curled
all round, and deeper
at the back than the
front, and having a
tall crown; 1 ounce
of purple wool, and
3 ounces of white 4-ply
“Beehive” Scotch
Fingering; five No.
14 long steel knitting-needles.
The fifth
needle is only required for the brim
where there are too many stitches for
three needles.</p>

<p>Hat shapes alter, of course, from
time to time, but the general principles
remain the same, and by a little
adaptation, this can be made to suit
any shape of the “sailor” class.</p>

<p class='sub'>Directions.</p>

<p>Commence by casting on 2 st on
each of three needles. Knit 1st row
plain.</p>

<p><i>2nd Row.</i>—Knit twice into each st,
thus—knit the st, but retain it on the
left needle, twist the point of the
right needle round to the back of the
st and knit the other side of this st,
then drop the st off the left needle.
Repeat into every st.</p>

<p><i>3rd Row, and every Alternate Row.</i>—Knit
plain.</p>

<p><i>4th Row.</i>—* Knit 1, knit twice into
next st, repeat from *.</p>

<p><i>6th Row.</i>—* Knit 2, knit twice into
each st, repeat from *.</p>

<p><i>8th Row.</i>—* Knit 3, knit twice into
next st, repeat from *.</p>

<p>Continue in this way, increasing
the number of stitches in each section
by 1 st before the increase until in
the 46th row, there are 24 st in each
section, that is 144 st in the row.</p>

<p>Knit 42 rows on the 144 st.</p>

<p><i>89th Row.</i>—* Knit 11, knit twice
into the next st, repeat from *.</p>

<p><i>90th Row.</i>—Knit plain and repeat
these 2 rows until the number in each
section is increased to 20, then knit
10 rows of the 240 st.</p>

<p>Use the spare needle to take off
some of the stitches, putting 60 st on
each of the 4 needles.</p>

<p>Work in ribbing of knit 1, purl 1
all round for 16 rows, then cast off
the stitches on 2 of the needles, continue
on the other 2 the ribbing for
the wide part of the brim, casting off
4 st at the beginning and end of
every row (composed of the stitches
on the 2 needles), until this piece
measures 1½ inches, then cast off.</p>

<p>It will be necessary to fit the covering
to the shape to see that it fits
evenly, and to add or subtract a row
or two perhaps to the part for each
portion of the shape, while working.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pretty and
Durable.</div>

<p>Stretch the covering over the shape
and tack along the line between the
crown and brim to the shape, turn
the wrong side of the hat towards
you and gather up the edge of the
covering to fit the shape along the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
edge of the crown. Sew the knitting
securely to this edge of the shape.
Headline the hat and press the brim
with a warm iron, placing a damp
cloth under and over it; iron until
the cloths are quite dry.</p>


<p class='sub'>The Band.</p>

<p>This is made in the new floral
knitting, and gives a nice finish to a
very useful and becoming hat.</p>

<p>Using the same kind of white wool
and 2 needles, cast on 20 st and work
30 rows, 1 plain and 1 purl row alternately,
so that there is a right and a
wrong side to the band.</p>

<p><i>31st Row.</i>—Knit 13 (using the white
wool), tie on the purple wool close up
to the 13th st, and knit 4 p (purple),
then finish the row with white.</p>

<p>When using two or more colours in
this class of knitting, one of the
wools is stretched across the fingers
of the left hand just as in crochet,
and the wool for the stitch taken
from this by inserting the needle
under it and drawing the loop
through the stitch you are knitting
on the left-hand needle. Keep the
different wools at opposite sides of
your work, so as not to tangle them,
and see that the wools on the back of
the work are kept even and not pulled
too tightly, otherwise the work will
pucker.</p>

<p><i>32nd Row.</i>—Purl 7 w (white), 1 p
(purple), 12 w.</p>

<p><i>33rd Row.</i>—Knit 11 w (always slipping
the 1st st), 1 p, 8 w.</p>

<p>Press this band on the wrong side
as in the brim, turn in each end to
form an angle, and secure on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
wrong side with a few stitches made
with the woollen thread, press the
ends flat, then place the band round
the hat in the manner illustrated and
sew in place.</p>


<p class='sub'>To Wash the Hat.</p>

<p>The covering and band are easily
removed from the shape when it
becomes necessary to clean the hat.</p>

<p>Make a lather of warm soapy water,
immerse the covering and press and
squeeze through the hands, but do
not rub, until it seems clean, then
squeeze out all the water possible
and rinse in clean warm water, again
squeeze as dry as possible, and place
immediately before the fire until
nearly, but not quite, dry. Have the
wrong side turned out. Press on the
wrong side with a hot iron until
quite dry, pull into shape, and
replace over the buckram.</p>

<p>The band, or covering, if it be
made with coloured wool, should
have a handful of salt added to the
lather and rinsing water.</p>

<h2>Fancy Tops for Socks and
Stockings.</h2>


<p>Very pretty effects can be obtained
for turnover stocking tops by working
in plain knitting in two or three
shades of wool. The designs
illustrated are worked in
grey wool, with black and
white introduced just to
show the contrast, and when
worked in bright colours
many of these would be very
effective. For instance, saxe
blue and a bright brown
would be pretty on a grey
sock, and emerald green and
white on a navy sock is another
combination; or the boy’s
particular school colours can be
introduced, giving a uniform
touch to his rig-out.</p>

<p>These tops are not at all
difficult to work, and can be
added to any sock directions.
They are best commenced
with six or eight rows of
ribbing, as this makes them
set well, and when the fancy
design is completed the work
is turned before commencing the
sock itself. Care must be taken to
see that you have the correct multiple
of stitches for the particular
design chosen, and, if necessary, add
the required number to give this
after the ribbing, decreasing them
to the original number again, to get
the even rib before commencing
the sock.</p>

<p>Another point that should be borne
in mind is, that the wools must be
allowed to run very loosely, or the
design will become contracted. You
can also quite easily prevent the
wools becoming twisted together in
the working, if in changing from one
wool to another you weave the wools
first over, and then under the shade
previously used.</p>

<p>If you find you have the
design contracted a little
when finished, pressing with
a hot iron over a damp cloth
will often relieve this. In
fact, all knitted garments are
the better for being pressed
in this way.</p>

<p>The directions given are for
a sock for a boy of from six
to seven years of age, and the
leg measures 11½ inches to
the base of the heel when
the top is turned over; the
foot measures seven inches
from heel to toe.</p>

ounce each of white and black wool,
and four No. 15 steel needles.</p>

<p>With grey wool cast on 64 st, 22
on each of two needles and 20 on the
third needle. Work in rib of K 2,
and P 2 for 8 rounds. Work one plain
round, increasing your number of st
to 70, then commence the fancy top,
using the three wools as follows:</p>

<p><i>10th and 11th Rounds.</i>—4 grey (G),
3 white (W), 4 G, 3 black (B). Repeat.</p>

<p><i>24th and 25th Rounds.</i>—4 G, 3 W,
4 G. 3 B. Repeat.</p>

<p>Work a plain round in the grey
wool and decrease your stitches to 64
again.</p>

<p>Turn the work, and commence the
sock in rib of K 3, P 1.</p>

<p>Work for 5½ inches, then commence
shaping for the leg as follows: K 1,
N, work in rib to the four last st of
the round N, K 1, P 1.</p>

<p>Decrease in this way four times,
with 7 rows between each decreasing.</p>

<p>Work an inch without shaping,
then divide the st, putting half on to
one needle for the heel, taking care
that the decreasings made come in
the centre of the needle.</p>


<p class='sub'>The Heel.</p>

<p>Make an extra stitch, so that you
have an odd number on the needle
(you should then have 29 st), and knit
and purl a row alternately (always
slipping the first st) until you have
worked the same number of rows as
you have st on the needle, ending
with a purl row.</p>

<p>K 16, N, K 1, turn.</p>

<p>P 5, Purl 2 together, P 1, turn.</p>

<p>K 6, N, K 1, turn.</p>

<p>P 7, Purl 2 together, P 1, turn, and
continue in
this manner
until all the
stitches
have been
worked on
to one needle
again.</p>


<p>Pick up
14 loops at
each side of
the heel,
and commence
working in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
rounds again for the foot, continuing
the rib on the instep needles, but
working in plain knitting for the
under part of the foot.</p>

<p>In the first round narrow at each
side, by taking the two lowest stitches
picked up from the side of the heel
flap together.</p>

<p>Repeat this decreasing three times,
with 1 round between each. Continue
the foot without further shaping
for 3½ inches, when you will be ready
for the toe.</p>


<p class='sub'>The Toe.</p>

<p>Put half your st on the
heel needle, and divide
the remainder between
the other two needles.
Work the toe in plain
knitting all round, decreasing
at each end of
the heel needle, and at
the outer end of the
other needles every other
round, until you have
only 20 st left in the
round. Place these on to
two needles, and cast off
both needles together.</p>

<h2>Making a Child’s Overall from a
Narrow Skirt.</h2>


<p>Good quality washing materials for
making children’s everyday frocks
are now so very much more expensive
than in pre-war days, that the economical
woman who happens to have
a number of washing skirts of the
narrower type so popular a few years
ago, would be wise to make some
good use of them.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 146px;">
<img src="images/i036.jpg" width="146" height="350" alt="Child in pinafore" />
<div class="caption">THE OVERALL THAT CAN BE
CUT FROM A NARROW SKIRT.</div>
</div>
<p>While it is a comparatively
simple matter for
the woman who makes
her own clothes to remodel
a full skirt into a
narrow design quite
successfully, it is not so
simple to adapt a narrow
design to a wider pattern.
Even if one could match
the material, it is never
wise to use new fabric
with old, and the freshness
of the new material
would only give emphasis
to the fact that the other
parts were slightly worn.</p>

<p>Here is a suggestion
that may not have occurred
to everyone. Have
you ever thought what
really excellent little
garments for the children
can be made from the
best parts of a cotton
skirt? As an example, we are showing
how the child’s overall illustrated
can be cut from a two-piece skirt of
quite the narrowest type (this design
only measures 1⅜ yards round the
hem) without even cutting into the
parts that are likely to be the most
worn.</p>



<p>Whether the skirt used is made of
linen, piqué, casement
cloth, or any of the
stouter washing fabrics,
it would serve admirably
for making this little
frock that can either be
worn as an overall over
another frock, or as a
little summer play frock
without another dress
underneath.</p>

<p>The skirt made use of
in this instance is a two-gored
design, with a seam
at each side, and to cut
the pattern as shown on
the diagram, the hem of
the skirt should be unpicked,
also the side
seams from the waist to
just below the hips, or
just far enough to allow
of the skirt being laid
flat out on the table.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Easy to Make and
to Slip On.</div>

<p>Take care to see that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
you have the skirt placed so that
there is an even fold at centre back
and front, and the side seams back
one another, then lay on your pattern.
You will see that in placing the
sleeve portion it comes over the side
seam of the skirt, giving you two
seams in the sleeve instead of one,
but the second seam will come on the
under-arm so that it will not in any
way spoil the appearance of the
garment. The collar and cuff portions
will need to be lined in order
to neaten them, and you will probably
find sufficient from the cuttings
to cut these out again, or if not, a
small piece of white calico could
quite well be used for this.</p>

<img src="images/i037.jpg" width="468" height="231" alt="pattern layout" />
<div class="caption">A DIAGRAM FOR CUTTING OUT
THE OVERALL FROM A SKIRT.</div>
</div>

<p>The back of the overall is cut down
from neck to hem, and finished with
a hem at each side, and fastened with
buttons and buttonholes.</p>

<p>Many varieties of trimming could
be used for a little overall of this
description. French knots worked
in a contrasting colour along the hem
and round the collar and cuffs would
be effective, or some simple cross-stitch
animal designs would look
well.</p>

<p>Use Clark’s “Anchor” Coton à
Broder, No. 12.</p>

<p>A frock for a two-year old has been
used as an example, but it would be
quite possible to cut a larger size in
a like manner, though it might be
necessary to put a false hem of some
other material.</p>

<h2>Re-footing made Easy.</h2>


<div class="figright" style="width: 230px;">
<img src="images/i038.jpg" width="230" height="318" alt="sock" />
<div class="caption">A Hand-knit Sock showing the replaceable foot
sections, and the method of reinforcing the heel.</div>
</div>

<p>This method of
knitting hose
renders it an easy
matter to repair
the heel and toe
when these parts
become worn.
By simply undoing
the end
stitch of a row
of crochet chain
stitches, the sole,
heel, or toe part
can be almost
instantly removed
by pulling
the thread and
undoing the
crochet. The
chain stitches
are used to join
the different
parts, which are worked separately
and then joined together.</p>

<p>When the worn part is removed, a
piece exactly the same size is knitted
and joined to the remainder of the
sock with the row of chain stitches.
In this way the leg and instep
portions, which seldom wear out,
may be made to serve for two or
three renewals of the parts exposed
to wear.</p>

<p>It is just as easy to knit a sock or
stocking in the new way as in the
old, and the saving effected by the
new way is great, especially now,
when woollen thread is both scarce
and expensive. The same may be
said about cotton thread.</p>

<p>The sock or stocking is begun in
the usual way, and may be made
either plain or ribbed.</p>

<p>The sock illustrated is a full-size
man’s sock, and the joinings are
shown in the dark line round the
heel, along the
side of the foot,
and across the instep
at the beginning
of the front
toe part.</p>

<p>These joinings
were made in
black thread on
the white sock in
order to show the
joinings, but in
making a sock
they must all be
worked with the
same thread as in
the sock. Then
the joinings are
not visible on the
outside, nor is
there a seam on
the inside, as the
row of chain stitches forms a flat
line.</p>


<p class='sub'>Working the Leg.</p>

<p>In the sock shown here 80 st were
cast on three No. 12 knitting-needles.
On these were worked 4 inches of
ribbing—1 plain, 1 purl. Then
5 inches of plain knitting with a
back seam.</p>


<p class='sub'>The Instep.</p>

<p>Divide for the heel, putting 20 st
at each side of the back seam, all on
one needle. Divide the 39 remaining
st on to the two needles, and continue
knitting on these (leaving
the heel needle for the present), knit
and purl alternate rows until the
piece is 6 inches long. Put the 39 st
on one needle, and leave this part
aside for the present.</p>


<p class='sub'>The Heel.</p>

<p>Cast on 41 st on a needle in “slip
loops,” that is, wind the thread once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
round the top of the thumb, and
take over the loop so formed on to
the needle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Renewing Worn
Portions.</div>

<p>Knit the 41 loops, purling the 21st
for the back seam, which is preserved
for the entire heel.</p>

<p>Purl the next row, then knit and
purl alternate rows until there are
24 rows in all.</p>


<p class='sub'>Closing the
Heel.</p>

<p><i>1st Row.</i>—Knit to the 9th st after
the back seam, slip the 10th st, k next
stitch, pull the slipped
stitch over, k 1, turn
(leaving 8 st).</p>

<p><i>2nd Row.</i>—Slip 1st
st and pull back to
the 10th after the
back seam, purl 10th
and 11th together,
purl next st, turn and
repeat these 2 rows
until all the stitches
at each side have been
taken in. Cut the
thread, leaving a short
end attached.</p>


<p class='sub'>The Sole.</p>

<p>There should now
be 24 st at each side
of the heel, and 23
along the top of it.
Cast on a number
equal to these, 71,
with the “slip loops.”
K and p alternate
rows for 4 rows. Then
decrease in every
plain row in the 3rd
and 4th st from each
end, thus:—k 2, sl 1,
k 1, pass the slipped
st over, k to the 4th st
from the end, k 4th
and 3rd together, k 2.</p>

<p>Continue until the stitches are
reduced to 39, to correspond with the
stitches on the instep.</p>

<p>Knit this piece until it is exactly
the same length as the instep
portion.</p>

<p class='sub'>The Toe.</p>

<p>Take two additional needles, cast
on 20 st on one, and 19 on the other,
following after those on the sole
needle, making the “slip loops” as before.
Join round, and k 2 rows plain.</p>

<p>Decrease in the next round thus:—k<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>

pass the slipped st over, k to the
4th st from the end of this needle,
k 3rd and 2nd together, k 2.</p>

<p>Knit first 2 st on next needle, sl 1,
k 1, pass the slipped st over, k
remainder of needle, k next needle
to the last 4 st, k 4th and 3rd st
together, k 2.</p>

<p>Knit 6 rounds. Decrease as before.</p>

<p>Knit 5 rounds. Decrease. Knit
4 rounds. Decrease.</p>

<p>Knit 3 rounds. Decrease.</p>

<p>Knit 2 rounds. Decrease.</p>

<p>Decrease in every 2nd round until
there are 11 st remaining on the sole
needle. Put back and front needles
together, and taking a corresponding
stitch from each needle, cast off
2 together. Draw the thread through
last loop and cut it, leaving a short
end.</p>


<p class='sub'>The Method of
Joining.</p>

<p>Commencing at the back part of
the leg portion, place the heel in
position, having the wrong sides
turned towards you.</p>

<p>With a No. 1 steel crochet hook,
make a chain on the end of the
thread, insert the hook through the
1st st on the heel, and through the
1st st on the needle of the leg portion,
draw a loop through these 2 together,
and through the chain on the hook,
insert the hook through the next st
on the heel, slip off the joined st on
the needle, insert the hook through
the next st on the needle, draw a loop
through the 2 st and the loop on
the needle, repeat to the end of the
needle, then take up the foot part,
and put it in place on the heel. Join
in the same way, inserting the hook
through corresponding stitches.
Continue up the side, across the
instep and along to the heel again.
Fasten the thread, leaving about an
inch of it. Work the end into the
following stitches to conceal it.</p>

<p>It can be readily seen that when
any part is worn and requires to be
renewed, the joining thread can be
cut and unravelled as far as required.</p>


<p class='sub'>To Renew the
Toe Portion.</p>

<p>Undo the chain stitches along the
front, cut the sole part in a line with
the front, unpick the threads to get
an even line of stitches, pick these
up on a needle, and knit the toe
piece exactly like the first one. Join
to the front in the same manner.</p>


<p class='sub'>To Reinforce the
Heel and Toe.</p>

<p>It is not generally known that
these parts can be so reinforced that
their durability is prolonged two or
three times. The best method of
doing this is shown in the sock
illustrated.</p>

<p>“Star Sylko” No. 5, matching the
colour of the sock, is worked into
the lines of knitted stitches, using a
darning needle for the purpose.</p>

<p>Take up one side of each st on the
needle, draw the thread through,
working in perpendicular rows, come
back on the other side of the stitches
down to where the 1st row was
commenced, and so on. In this way
the cotton thread is all on the outside
of the woollen knitting, and receives
all the friction from the shoe, while
it never comes next to the skin.
The dark strip down the heel shows
where the strengthening stitches
have been worked in.</p>


<p class='sub'>To Re-Knit a Heel and Toe
into a Machine-Knit Sock.</p>

<p>In the machine-knit sock the heel
and toe are not made in the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
way as in most of the hand-knit
variety, but usually on the lines of
the illustration at bottom of page.
In the case of the heel, a portion of
the leg has been worked to show
how the heel is made straight on to
this.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Repairing Machine-made
Socks.</div>

<p>Cut away the heel at its base to the
1st decreasing st. Make a cut across
the sole next the heel in a line with
the 3rd decreasing at each side.</p>

<p>Turn back 3 rows under the sole,
where they must be secured with a
flat seam, using a piece of the same
kind of thread and a darning needle.
Pick up the stitches at the base of
the heel on to a knitting needle.
Fasten the thread and knit a row.
Then purl and knit alternate rows,
taking the first 2 st together in every
row until the st are reduced to one-third
of those in the 1st row.</p>

<p>Continue working a plain and a
purl row alternately on these stitches,
increasing by picking up a loop at
the end of each row from the side of
the flap just worked, until you have
closed the heel, and have the original
number of stitches on the needle.
Join to the sole part with a row of
crochet chain stitches.</p>


<p class='sub'>The Toe
Part.</p>

<p>This is worked exactly like the
heel, picking up one-half of the st
round the foot part. Knit the toe
part as in the heel, working back to
close the toe in the same way, then
join to the front part with a row of
chain stitches.</p>

<h2>How to Re-heel a Worn Sock.</h2>


<p>When the heel only becomes worn
out in a hand-knitted sock or stocking,
it is an easy matter to replace
the worn-out portion and the
adjacent weak parts.</p>

<p>If possible, let the
mending thread be
a little finer in
texture than
that used in
the stocking,
and when not
possible to
match the thread
in colour use
white—in fact,
many people prefer
white heels and toes
in their hosiery.</p>

<p>We are illustrating
a grey sock re-heeled
with white to show clearly
how the work is done.
Run a coloured thread
through each stitch at the
base of the heel in a straight
line from side to side. In the
same way run another piece of thread
through the stitches at the top of
the sole where it adjoins the heel
“closing” portion, that is from the
first to the last stitch on the centre
of the heel to where the stitches at
each side of the heel were raised.</p>

<p>Now count the number of rows in
the heel before the “closing” was
begun, and the number of stitches at
each side of the back seam after the
closing was finished. Take a note of
these, as the piece re-knitted must
fit exactly.</p>

<p>Cut away the worn part that you
wish to replace from the second row
<i>inside</i> the marking thread, and the
second row from each side where the
side stitches were taken up. Pick
out the cut threads from each side
of the heel until you come to the
“raised” stitches, which you may
leave for the present as they
cannot ravel.</p>

<p>Pick out the cut threads
from the rows inside
the marking
threads in
the same
way. The
marking
thread should
be through every
stitch so that they
cannot ravel.</p>

<p>Take up the stitches
at the base of the
heel and re-knit
exactly as it was before
and close it in the same
way. Tie the thread
when the last row in the
heel closing is done, cut it
and work the end in through
the stitches.</p>

<p>Thread a darning needle with
a length of the same kind of thread
and fasten the thread to the beginning
of the heel at the right side. * Run
the needle behind the next of the
“raised” stitches on the sole at the
base of that stitch, bring it back to the
heel, and running it inwards through
the first stitch where it was brought
out bring it out through the next heel
stitch and repeat from * up to the
stitches on the needle which are
connected to those on the thread in
the same way, slipping off each
stitch when joined. Work down the
other side in the same way, fasten off
the thread and cut it. Work in the
end of the thread through a few stitches.
Remove the marking threads.
This heel will have no seam.</p>

<h2>Slippers you can Make.</h2>

<div class="figright" style="width: 306px;">
<img src="images/i043a.jpg" width="306" height="139" alt="black slippers" />
<div class="caption">A PAIR OF MEN’S SLIPPERS.</div>
</div>

<p>Footwear, like everything
else, is exceedingly
high-priced at
present, and to know
how to economize in
this direction is a
serious problem. But
have you ever thought
of making your slippers?
This is really
quite possible. Indeed,
there is no
reason why very presentable shoes
and slippers cannot be made at
home. In nearly every household
the materials are already at hand.
Pieces of velvet, tweed, felt or cloth
are all suitable, and to show what
can be done in this way we illustrate
here two pairs of comfortable slippers
made from oddments.</p>

<p>The first is a neat pair made from
a piece of left-over dress material, in
black and white woollen check, a bit
of red flannel for lining and some
navy serge coating for the soles,
which are formed over the usual
cardboard. Then the pair of men’s
slippers were built up on a pair of
leather soles with fleecy lining.
Grey tweed left over from making a
boy’s suit was utilised, and a scrap of
blue flannel shirting forms the
lining.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i043b.jpg" width="300" height="132" alt="plaid slippers" />
<div class="caption">SLIPPERS MADE FROM CHECK MATERIAL.</div>
</div>

<p>You will probably see the advantage
of making these at home, and
any comfortable old slipper can be
cut up for a pattern.</p>

<p>They are made in the same way if
you make the soles yourself, but with
the purchased slipper sole there is a
slight difference in the manner of
attaching the upper.</p>


<p class='sub'>The Check
Slippers.</p>

<p>In cutting the upper, no turnings
will need to be allowed for the
upper edge, but allow a margin
of a quarter-inch around the side
which comes next to the sole. Cut
both lining and material the same
size.</p>


<p class='sub'>The Sole.</p>

<p>Cut this out in stiff cardboard,
then cut a covering for it from the
lining material, allowing a half-inch
margin all round.
Place the cardboard
on the centre, and
draw the edges of the
lining together from
opposite sides with
crossing stitches,
using stout linen
thread for this purpose
and a coarse
sewing needle. The
cardboard must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
covered smoothly and securely with
the flannel and gatherings made at
the heel and toe parts. The upper
side of this sole is the inside of the
shoe, and the stitching underneath.
Now lay this sole on another piece
of cardboard, and cut out the shape
again just one-eighth of an inch
larger all round. Lay this on the felt
or piece of tweed intended for the
outer sole and cut out the shape.
Take the cardboard pattern for this
sole and cut away a quarter-inch
margin around. This smaller shape
is put between the inner and outer
soles when making up the shoe.
Stitch up the side seams in material
and lining. Press both seams out
flat, place opposite to each other and
tack the lining along the top edge to
the check material. Now bind the
edges together with a strip of ribbon
or narrow tape. It is as well to
stiffen the back of the slipper a little
with an interlining of thin cardboard
or tailor’s canvas.</p>

<p>Now take up the flannel covered
sole and place the upper over it,
having the smooth side of the sole
turned from you; sew the edge of the
upper very securely to the wrong side
of the sole, putting the stitches into
the flannel only, and about an eighth
of an inch from the extreme edge.
Lay the small cardboard sole over
the one just put in and secure it with
a couple of stitches, place the tweed
sole on top of it with its edge overlapping
evenly all round. Using thick
black thread, the stronger the better,
slip-stitch the sole through the inside
edge to the upper where it turns in
under the first sole. It is necessary
to notch the edge of the cardboard
stiffening where it overlaps the sole,
in order to make it lie flat.</p>


<p class='sub'>The Men’s
Slippers.</p>

<p>The same directions apply to these
with the exception of the mode of
attaching the ready-made sole. Turn
in both edges of the uppers and tack
securely around, then top-sew together,
place over the sole and stitch
the sewn edges to the middle section
of the sole, turning back the leather
edge for this purpose. No binding
was used for this slipper, but the
lining had its edge turned in as well
as the material, then the lining was
tacked with the turned in edge
coming a little above the material
so as to form a narrow piping around
the top.</p>

<h2>Mending a Man’s Shirt.</h2>


<div class="figright" style="width: 304px;">
<img src="images/i045a.jpg" width="304" height="226" alt="cuffs laid out" />
<div class="caption">CUFFS FOR ATTACHING TO WHITE SHIRTS.</div>
</div>

<p>One of
the many
expensive
necessaries
in these
expensive
days is a
man’s
white
shirt. In
many
cases the
finished
article is
treble the
price it
was in
1914. This is partly due, of course,
to the increase in the cost of labour,
as there is a considerable amount of
skilled work entailed in the cutting
out and putting together of a man’s
white shirt. And the high price is
partly to be accounted for by the
increased cost of materials.</p>

<p>But with all the care in the world,
shirts will still wear out, and must
somehow be replaced. Fortunately
this difficulty is not such a serious
one as it at first appears; a shirt can
quite easily be renovated—and without
having that amateurish look that
so often just spoils things.</p>


<p class='sub'>Repairing
Shirt Tails.</p>

<p>The first
parts to
go, very
often, in
a man’s
shirt are
the tails.
Well, the
simplest
way to
deal with
this is to
cut them
off right
across,
above the weak places. This is really
far more satisfactory than patching.
A piece of calico or longcloth from
another discarded article is not difficult
to get. Measure the same size
as the portion cut off. Hem round
three sides. Run and fell the fourth
side to the shirt itself.</p>

<p>Perhaps you did not know, as I did
not myself until recently, that many
of the essential details which go to
make up the shirt, can be purchased
separately. In this way a weak front
or collar, or the cuffs can be removed,
a new one substituted, and you have
a new shirt without its cost.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 452px;">

<div class="caption">TWO KINDS OF COLLAR BANDS.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>Cuffs are parts that soon show signs
of wear, and frayed cuffs gives the
shirt—and the man—a weary look.
In this case, unpick the cuffs if
possible, if not, cut them off close up.
The new cuffs can be bought into
which the sleeve is inserted, and the
shirt regains its sprightly appearance.
At the time of writing, the
price of these cuffs is 6½d. and 8½d.
per pair, and the result is well worth
this small expenditure.</p>

<div class="caption">A FRONT FOR A SHIRT FASTENING
AT THE BACK.</div>
</div>

<p>Another method of repairing the
cuffs is to cut off the frayed cuff, and
put on a narrow band. In this case,
separate cuffs would be worn. You
do not even need to make these
bands yourself. They can be bought
ready for use.</p>


<p class='sub'>About Collar Bands.</p>

<p>Most women have, at one time or
another, struggled with the shirt collar-bands
of their menfolk. When
it is your first one,
you start off quite
happily. After all,
you say, it is a simple
matter to cut such a
band, and will only
require a small piece
of material. But you
soon find out that it
is not so simple as it
looks, and, being
shaped, needs more
material than you had
thought for. And
when you have finished
it, you have
neither satisfied yourself,
nor the owner of
the shirt. Men often
assume a superior indifference
to clothes,
but there are certain
things about which
no indifference is visible,
one being the
collar band of their
shirt. Collar-bands
are cut in a scientific
manner, and even
experienced workers,
knowing that they are
not very easy to make,
will probably be as
thankful as less advanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
workers, to
buy them shaped and
stitched, ready for
applying to the shirt.
These collar-bands
can be bought singly
or in half dozens, and
can be supplied opening
at the front or
back, according to the
fastening of the shirt
for which they are
needed. The present
price of these collar-bands
is 3d. each.
They are made in
white calico, also in
sateen for coloured
shirts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fronts that you
can Buy.</div>


<p class='sub'>When Buttonholes
are Torn.</p>

<p>“But,” says someone,
“buttonholes
are my trouble. You
can’t, surely, buy new
buttonholes to replace
the broken
ones?” True, but
the case is by no
means hopeless.
If this is your difficulty two courses
are open to you. Either refront the
shirt, or else an additional front can
be worn outside the white shirt.
This latter plan would perhaps be too
warm in the summer, though an extra
front is a useful addition in the
winter. The use of separate fronts
and cuffs help to solve the ever-present
laundry problem, as these
can be sent to the laundry for stiffening
and polishing, while the unstiffened
shirts can be washed at
home, thus effecting a very considerable
saving in expense.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 295px;">
<img src="images/i047.jpg" width="295" height="405" alt="white fabric with v-opening" />
<div class="caption">A FRONT FOR A SHIRT FASTENING IN FRONT.</div>
</div>

<p>If, however, the separate front is
objected to, you can buy fronts for
letting into worn shirts. There are
two kinds, the front in one piece for
shirts fastening at the back, and the
dividing front for shirts fastening in
front. These are supplied square, as
shown in the illustration. There are
two qualities, price 9½d. and 1/-.</p>

<p>To apply the new front, first tack it
on to the old front, then cut it to the
shape required, allowing sufficient
margin to turn in a fell. Then cut
away the unnecessary material at the
back from the shirt, leaving here
sufficient to turn in a fell. In this way
you have practically a new shirt again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>These are the portions that are
most likely to show signs of stress
and wear. Should any rents occur
elsewhere, a little patch must be
added.</p>


<p class='sub'>A Patch may be
Necessary.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to remind
you that it is better to mend and
patch with material that is not quite
new. Very often a pillow-case that
is worn in one part will supply a
sufficient amount of sound material
for re-tailing a shirt.</p>

<p>In looking through the shirts of
your menfolk, you will probably find
one wants a new collar-band, another
new cuffs, another a front, and so on.
They will not all need repairing in
every direction. But even if they
did, and you had to get several new
portions for one shirt, it would be
well worth your while, as the cost of
these portions is very slight.</p>

<h2>Mending a Collar.</h2>


<p>Men’s collars
are among those
articles that one
had come to regard
as useless as soon
as they are torn or
worn, and therefore
at the first
sign of disrepair
to be replaced by
new ones. Yet
collars nowadays
are a far more expensive
item than
they were a few
years back; a frequent
supply of
new collars means
a considerable outlay.
Before discarding
the torn
collar, therefore,
it is well to see
if it is not possible
to repair it, and
it nearly always is
possible.</p>

<div class="caption">A BUTTONHOLE TEAR AND HOW TO
MEND IT</div>
</div>

<p>The tear usually
occurs in the little
projecting flap for
the buttonhole,
either where this
piece joins the
main part of the
collar, or the
buttonhole itself.
Two such tears are
illustrated. Now
either of these can
be very easily
mended with a
piece of tape.
First of all, wash
all the starch out
of the collar.
When quite dry,
tack a small piece
of tape over the
tear, as illustrated,
and machine it in
place. This makes
a perfectly neat
mend, and is quite
easy to do. Moreover
when the
collar is starched
again, the tape
does not show.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>




<h2>The Wisdom of Preventive Mending.</h2>


<p>We do not, nowadays, spend long
hours bending over fine stitchery
that is destined for no really useful
purpose. To efficiently understand
how to mend and how to make is our
more practical aim. A distinctive
and imperative branch of this knowledge
is the art of preventive mending.</p>

<p>From the gracious days of our
grandmothers, or our even more
remote ancestors, comes a lavender-scented
remembrance of patiently
executed needlework, almost unbelievably
fine; wonderful samplers
were made and monumental pictures
depicting Bible scenes were toiled
over until the last of the innumerable
stitches was filled in, and the triumph
ready to be framed and hung up on
the wall of the best parlour.</p>

<p>Some of us possess examples of
these forgotten arts, bead necklaces
so finely constructed that, entirely
handmade and needle-threaded as they
were, they altogether surpass the
pretty ornaments of the present day,
made upon apache looms. Samplers,
too, we fondly cherish, if we are
fortunate enough to have had one or
two handed
down from
mother to
daughter in our
family.</p>


<p class='sub'>The Day of the
Ready-Mades.</p>

<p>But life to-day
is more strenuous;
the pride
of the needlewoman
must,
in the majority
of cases, have
a more practical
aim. We do
not despise the
lavender-scented sweetness and tranquility—sometimes
we even sigh for
the qualities that can only come to
perfection in days of unhurried calm—but
we recognise the every-day
usefulness of the modern needlewoman
and applaud the sanity of
her methods.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 229px;">
<img src="images/i049.jpg" width="229" height="219" alt="mother teachign daughter to mend" />
<div class="caption">Children may be taught that darning is
really quite an interesting occupation.</div>
</div>

<p>Microscopic stitching is a delightfully
interesting pursuit for the
woman of leisure. The busy girl or the
house-mother, harassed with many
cares, would not find such sewing a
sedative for tense and weary nerves;
but the capable woman with quick,
deft fingers and mind alert, finds it
both interesting and exhilarating, in
its practicality, to sit down and either
make or mend something.</p>

<p>Mending and altering are two
branches of the great art of Needlecraft
which no woman can afford to
despise in these days of ready-made
frocks and shop-bought costumes.
Turnings may be insufficient, buttons
sewn on with too scant stitches,
hooks and eyes trembling to fall off,
but these deficiencies very easily can
be put to rights. And the business
girl would find
herself sorely
pressed for time
to do the necessary
shopping,
matching trimmings,
and the
travelling to
and from the
dressmaker for
fittings-on,
while not her
time alone but
her pocket also
would seriously
suffer if the
ready-to-wear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
gowns and
walking-suits
were suddenly
to be banished
from our
drapery stores.</p>

<p>A shop-bought
costume that
doesn’t fit, however,
isn’t cheap
at any price.
Learn, therefore,
how to
make alterations
in the
most common-sense
and
practical fashion, and take preventive
measures, before the garment is worn
for the first time, to overcome the
little deficiencies that we may expect
to discover in the “ready-mades.”</p>


<p class='sub'>Tools for the Practical
Needlewoman.</p>

<p>Chief among the aids for the
practical needlewoman, taking first
rank among her valuable assistants,
comes the sewing-machine. For hard
wear and every-day use machine-stitching
is generally much neater
and stronger than hand sewing, and
the pace, of course, is far quicker.
Her sewing-machine is a good friend
to the busy woman who has most
need to practise the art of preventive
mending, for strength and speed are
two of her chief demands.</p>

<p>It pays to understand one’s sewing-machine,
and to treat it with tender
care. Rough usage, or careless
handling through ignorance of the
rightful functions of the different
delicate pieces may lead to dire
disaster. A handbook of instructions
is always given when the machine is
purchased: cherish this book, for if
it is mislaid you
are at sea without
your chart.
The inexperienced
girl who
makes her early
attempt to
fathom the
mysteries of the
sewing-machine
will find that a
little personal
instruction
(which may
be had at the
depôt of her
own make of
machine) will be more helpful than
an hour spent in trying to solve
intricate problems by the aid of the
printed page. Later on, however, the
printed directions will read lucidly
enough when her mind is conversant
with the everyday workings of the
machine, and an intelligent glance at
her useful little handbook will disclose
to her the cause and the remedy
of the defective action.</p>

<p>Keep the machine scrupulously
clean and thoroughly well oiled. To
do this is again to recognise the
wisdom of preventive measures. An
un-oiled, dirty machine will always
cause trouble in working, for when
the parts do not run smoothly, dropped
and uneven stitches are a frequent
embarrassment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Sewing

<p>Oil in every part, and open and
turn back so that when the oil has
soaked through, the clogged dirt

<p>A capacious mending basket is a
necessity for the practical worker,
and it is all the more convenient if it
stands upon legs, table height, and
can be carried about to be stationed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
just within
comfortable
reach of the
mender’s right
hand.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 228px;">
<img src="images/i051.jpg" width="228" height="199" alt="woman sewing with machine" />
<div class="caption">Her sewing-machine is a good friend to
the busy woman who practises the art
of preventive mending.</div>
</div>

<p>Keep always
some tailor’s
canvas for use
as stiffening,
buckram for
millinery, white
leno, and fine
black lining,
rolls of old
linen and
flannel for
patching, stray pieces of lace, and
left-over lengths of embroidery or
insertions. Roll up all oddments in
soft, clean muslin with tape or label
attached, on which is written a list of
the trifles to be found within your
treasury.</p>

<p>If you frequently find your tape
measure mislaid, try this plan, and
thus prevent the long searching that
interrupts your sewing. Cut as long
a piece off your tape as will stretch
from end to end of your machine,
and paste it along the front edge of
the stand. It thus will be <i>always</i> at
hand when required, and will serve at
any rate for all the shorter measurements
required.</p>

<p>It is a good plan to assemble your
hooks and eyes on safety pins. Slip
the opened pin through the separate
hooks and eyes, then when they are
all securely dangling, firmly close
your safety pin, and they are ready
for use when needed and will not get
tangled and twisted together as so
often happens if they are kept in a
box.</p>

<p>Keep odd buttons in glass bottles.
No more hunting in the dark and
dust! You can
see the button
for which you
are searching,
and by shaking
the bottle can
bring it near to
the top, where
it can be easily
reached. Bone
or pearl buttons
for underwear,
or any others
that are not
affected by exposure,
may be
securely fixed upon a hairpin.
Straighten out one of the long hairpins,
bend back one end about a
quarter or half an inch, run the point
through the holes, and when your
buttons are neatly crowded together
turn up the other end to hold them
securely.</p>


<p class='sub'>Aids to Strength and
Durability.</p>

<p>We have heard that in China it is
the custom to pay the family doctor
to keep his patients in good health
rather than to call him in only after
illness has laid the sufferer low.
Many of us applaud this system, but
have neither the opportunity nor,
perhaps, the courage, to defy conventions
in England.</p>

<p>But why not pursue the same wise
course in dealing with household
mending? It works admirably.</p>

<p>Take that proverbial stitch that
“saves nine” in very good time, even
before there is any apparent need for
for it, and you’ll find it will work
miracles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Preventive
Mending.</div>

<p>Stockings, for instance. The toes
and heels of children’s stockings may
be neatly darned before they are worn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
for the first time, for this purpose
using crochet silk or mercerised
thread, which is less bulky and
clumsy than wool. Insist on frequent
change of hosiery, and forbid the
wearing of any stocking that shows
even the tiniest hole. To prevent
those long running ladders which are
almost impossible to mend, sew a
band of silk or cotton, or a border
cut from an old stocking, round each
hem of the new pair. Hose supporters
(chief cause of these destructive
ladders) will seldom cut through this
double band. Or another excellent
plan may be adopted. Take a round
brass ring and double crochet closely
over it to make a soft, firm covering.
Sew this securely into position upon
the stocking top with neat, strong
stitches, and always insert the clip
of the suspender within this ring.
You will thus make it impossible for
the tension to strain the stocking
beyond the area enclosed by the ring.</p>

<p>In the knees of children’s stockings
small shields may be placed, pieces
cut from other stockings and fastened
in so neatly that they are quite inconspicuous
and not at all uncomfortable.</p>

<p>The “ready-mades,” whether
visiting frocks, walking suits, or
underwear, as was hinted in a previous
paragraph, cry out loudly for
preventive mending. For instance,
sleeves should be stitched in by
machine, for on ready-made clothes
the machine stitching is not always
carefully done, and a weak place
in the sleeve seam will quickly
give way under strain and start an
ugly tear.</p>

<p>Embroidery with scalloped or
pointed edging should be machined
strongly all round the extreme edges,
the machine needle patiently following
the circuitous course of the
pattern. This will double the life of
embroidered lace, preventing frayed
untidiness and breaks, gaps and tears.</p>

<p>To prevent an embroidery flounce
from ragging out before the petticoat
itself is any the worse for wear, neatly
hem the edge as soon as it threatens
to fray or gets torn by an accidental
mis-step, and add a bordering of
Valenciennes or fine Torchon lace.</p>

<p>Buttons should receive careful
attention when any ready-made
garment is bought. The trimness
of effect and the general prettiness of
coat or costume may be entirely spoilt
if one of a set of distinctive buttons
is allowed to drop off and get lost.
Therefore sew on all buttons at the
time of your purchase. Stitch carefully
with a strong thread; when you
have sewn through and through the
button half a dozen times, wind your
thread round and round the strands
which hold the button, between the
button and the cloth, making a sort
of shank. Treat boot and shoe
buttons in the same way.</p>

<p>It is wise to strengthen bed-linen
with broad tape laid on at the corners,
inconspicuously stitched into position,
so that an added firmness is
given to the sheets where the clothes-pegs
might do most damage.</p>

<p>Look closely into the wool-worked
buttonholing at your blanket ends.
You may, with advantage, stitch
fresh buttonhole edgings that will
keep the neat turn-over, when the
blanket is in use, for a longer time
than if the shop-bought edging were
left to suffice.</p>

<p>Remember that half-an-hour spent
weekly in preventive mending, will
save the busy housewife hours of
darning and patching later on.</p>

<h2>For Keeping out the Wind.</h2>


<p class='sub'>The value of
old Kid Gloves.</p>

<p>With furs advanced 80 per cent. in
price in some cases, and every sort of
leather and skin at a premium, it is
evident that many who would like
new furs, and a leather waistcoat for
motoring, will have to forego these
for a while, now that such items
have become so expensive.</p>

<p>Those who are studying economy,
however, will find an excellent substitute
for the leather, and the fur
skins, in the old kid gloves that have
got beyond even the cleaner’s kindly
aid. It is always the fingers and
thumb that go; the remainder of the
glove will be a serviceable bit of kid.
These pieces can be used in
a variety of ways, and since
they are impervious to wind,
they may save you many a
chill—or more serious
illness,—if you find a new
thick winter coat beyond
your purse in these hard
times.</p>

<p>Cut off the fingers and
thumb, remove the fasteners,
cut the glove
up to the top at
the front opening,
and spread
it out flat—as you
see in the small
illustration.
There will be a
little fulness at
the thumb-pieces,
but this
can be doubled
over and stitched
down flat.</p>

<div class="caption">This shows some of the gloves stitched on the
flannel inter-lining.</div>
</div>

<p>Perhaps your
thickest coat is
not nearly thick
enough for the piercing east winds
that come to us in the early part of
the year, finding out our weak spots.</p>


<p class='sub'>For an Under-coat or Waistcoat.</p>

<p>If you wish to avoid the cost of a
new big coat, why not make a small
sleeveless coat, or a waistcoat to
wear under your outdoor coat? For
this you will need about 1½ yards of
silk for the outside, some thin flannel
for the interlining, and some more
silk, or other suitable material for
the lining. I suggest silk, because
this slips on so easily, and the outer
coat, in turn, slips on easily over the
silk waistcoat. It takes so little
material that in all probability you
can get enough out of the silk lining
of some discarded coat or
underskirt. Then of course
there are the old gloves.
Cut out the silk, outer and
lining, and the flannel, by
the same pattern. Deal
with the flannel first. Onto
this stitch the pieces of
glove—they merely want
pinning in place first of all,
and then run the machine
round each fragment.
Put them
on as they will
best cover the
flannel, it doesn’t
matter how irregular
it all is, so
long as the flannel
is completely
covered. It
doesn’t look elegant,
as you are
doing it; that
again, is unimportant,
as it is
all hidden by the
silk. If you have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
not enough gloves for your needs,
a few bits of chamois leather will
help you out.</p>

<p>Then make up the little
undercoat, with the
glove-covered flannel as
interlining, the kid
against the lining, and
you will find you have
something that keeps
out the wind in a way
a woollen hug-me-tight
could never do. And
the glove-lined garment
takes up so little room
that it does not add to
one’s bulk; in addition,
it is very light in weight—a
great advantage.</p>

<p>The idea is capable of
various developments.
A velvet stole edged with
a little fur could be interlined in the
same way. It would be light and
warm, and a real comfort on cold days.
It is quite surprising
how the kid interlining
adds to the warmth of a
garment.</p>

<p>A chest protector, like
the one we illustrate, is
invaluable for the girl
who has a weak chest,
and is out in all weathers.
This again is quite easy
to make.</p>

<p>In a garment like this,
or any large surface, it
is as well to run the
machine down the
material after the pieces
are all joined up; this
“quilts” it and holds it
together.</p>

<p class='sub'>For Men’s Waistcoats.</p>

<p>Many men complain that they feel
cold at their back, even though they
are wearing the thickest
of vests. This is probably
due to the fact that the
material used in making
the back of the waistcoat
is many degrees thinner
than that used for the
fronts. The defect can be
easily remedied, however,
if you have three or four
old pairs of gloves.</p>

<p>Cut out a piece of stout
black lining, the size of
the back piece of the
waistcoat. Stitch the
portions of the gloves to
the wrong side of this
lining. They will not
need to come below the
strap at the waist-line. Then turn in
the edges, and apply this to the inside
of the waistcoat (glove pieces inside of
course), and run it neatly
all round, taking care that
it does not show above
the top of the waistcoat
at the back. It will keep
it better in place if you
run a line of stitching
down the centre of the
back, from top to bottom,
after the lining has been
run on all round.</p>

<p>You will have a perfectly
neat looking garment
that simply looks like a
waistcoat with black
lining at the back.</p>

<p>I advise this lining
being put on by hand
rather than by machine.</p>

<h2>An Apron you can make from
a Summer Skirt.</h2>


<p>The attractive little apron
illustrated on this page has
been made with the expenditure
of very little time and
trouble, from a straight-gathered
cotton voile skirt.</p>

<p>The simple gathered full
type of skirt has been very
popular for the summer frock
during the last two or three
years, and when this has lost
its freshness for dress wear,
the material will often be
found to be in quite good
enough condition to turn to
account in the manner suggested.</p>

<p>At the top of the page the
skirt is shown before its
transformation; the two
lower figures give the front
and back views of the apron
when finished, and you will see that
it is quite a
becoming little
garment of the
fashionable
button-on-the-shoulder
style,
with straps
crossing at the
back.</p>

<p>To make the
apron, first take
your skirt and
rip the gathers
away from the
band at the top,
measure 30
inches from the
centre front of
the skirt folded
together, and
cut away the extra fulness
from the back. The larger
portion you have then forms
the apron. If the skirt you
are using happens to be one
that fastens with a seam at
the centre front, it will be
best to use the back of the
skirt for the centre front of
the apron, to avoid a seam
down the centre.</p>

<div class="caption">The back and front views of the finished Apron.</div>
</div>

<p>Unless the skirt is a very
short one, you will find it
will be quite long enough
without making any alteration
in the hem, but as most
skirts have a fairly deep hem,
it would be quite possible to
let this down if necessary.</p>

<p>To form the curved sides
for the under-arm, measure
12 inches along the top edge
from the centre front, and cut a half-circle
7 inches
deep and 12
inches across in
each side of the
apron.</p>

<p>Now take the
piece you cut
away from the
back of the
skirt, and from
this cut a
straight double
strip 12 inches
long and 4
inches deep for
the front yoke
band, and two
further double
strips each 17
inches long and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
4 inches wide for the shoulder straps.
Mitre one end of each of the shoulder
straps and slant the other ends,
taking 2 inches off the length for
the outer edge of the strap. If your
skirt should not be full enough to
give sufficient material for the
double straps, they could quite well
be lined with some other material,
or could even be made a little
narrower.</p>

<p>Finish the back edges of the apron
with narrow hems, also the armholes.
Gather the front and place between
the double yoke band. The backs
are also gathered and placed between
the slanting ends of the shoulder
straps, putting the shortest part of
the strap towards the back.</p>

<p>Cross the straps at the back of the
apron, and fasten the mitred ends to
the yoke band with buttons and
buttonholes. Your little apron is
then complete.</p>

<h2>Knitting Your Own Woollen
Spencers.</h2>


<p>Provided you are fond of knitting
and can work fairly quickly, you will
find it a great economy to make your
own woollen spencers.</p>

<p>If you are careful to select wool
of good quality, you will be well
rewarded for the time spent in
making, as hand-knitted woollens
can always be relied upon to show
less shrinkage with constant washing
than even the most reliable makes of
all-wool woven underwear.</p>

<h2>A Practical Way to Teach Girls
Dressmaking.</h2>


<div class="figright" style="width: 109px;">
<img src="images/i061.jpg" width="109" height="276" alt="Girl in dark dress" />
<div class="caption">A GIRL WEARING THE FROCK
SHE HAS MADE</div>
</div>

<p>Some of the ladies who have headed
sewing parties, or collected garments
for the soldiers and sailors, during
the past few years, could a tale unfold
of the mysterious articles that many
very willing workers have produced
in their anxiety to help. No sooner
was war declared than hundreds of
women, from every grade in society,
stepped forward, ready to make something;
but what of the shirts 6 ft.
long, the neckbands made of flannel—not
ones, nor twos, but dozens of
them, calling forth a special warning
from the daily Press?</p>

<p>And it must be borne in mind, that
many of these needlewomen must
have passed through our schools—elementary
or secondary—and have
spent a couple of hours every week,
for six or seven years, “learning
needlework”; likewise, the garments
required were not novelties, they are
worn by men in time of
peace as well as war.</p>

<p>Such a result of “learning
needlework” gives
one “furiously to think.”
Has the training in the
schools fitted the girls for
making and mending garments
for themselves and
others—remodelling old
ones, and generally using
the needle as a help
towards comfort and
economy in the home?</p>

<p>This brings us to a very
pertinent question. <i>Is</i> it
possible to give the girls
at school such a training
in the cutting out and making
of garments that the
work loses it terrors, and
comes within the grasp of them all?
Experience has proved that cutting
out paper garments from elaborate
diagrams, bristling with “inches in”
and “inches down,” is of very small
<i>practical</i> value. The secret of success
lies in getting the girls to measure a
real wearer, and then to make a
pattern, which they can properly
“try on” for themselves, from these
measurements.</p>


<p>Take, for example, the making of a
frock, such as the girl is wearing in
the picture. This child of twelve or
thirteen, was one of a class of thirty
or forty, in which every girl made a
similar dress for herself. All measuring,
making of patterns, cutting out
of the material, fixing and sewing—everything
in fact, from beginning
to end, was done by the girls
themselves.</p>

<img src="images/i062a.jpg" width="200" height="274" alt="one girl measuring another at neck" />
<div class="caption">THE FIRST MEASUREMENT FOR THE YOKE.</div>
</div>

<p>To begin with, they arranged themselves
in pairs, and each
girl cut a yoke, cuff and
sleeve pattern for her
companion. It was not
necessary to make a paper
pattern of the skirt of the
frock. No material was
cut until the patterns were
satisfactory.</p>

<p>A yoke is an exceedingly
useful and necessary
part of many garments,
but it is not, as a rule,
considered an easy thing
to cut a pattern of one to
fit a particular wearer;
but these girls found it
simple enough, by working
on the following plan.</p>

one girl taking the neck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
measurement of her friend; this is
the only one required for cutting the
pattern. It should be found, by
holding the tape loosely around the
neck, so that the head moves easily

</div>
<p>An oblong piece of paper—newspaper
will serve quite well—measuring
the neck length one way and one-and-a-half
times the same the other, was
then cut out. Thus, if the neck is
12 in., the paper will be 12 in. by 18 in.
(See Fig. 1). The method adopted of
getting the yoke from this, will be
seen by following each step in the
sketches. The two shorter sides were
folded together as in Fig. 2, forming
a double piece. The two top corners
were brought over until they met in
the middle, as in Fig. 3, and then the
triangular pieces cut off, leaving a
double piece, as in Fig. 4. Care must
be taken in the next step to bring
the slanting edge (A) next to the two
<i>open</i> straight edges, over to the
bottom edges D; thus A and D lie
exactly over each other, and the
second slanting edge B covers the
fold C.</p>

<p>The pattern begins now to look
something like a yoke, and is soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
complete. Two pieces must be cut
off, one to form the neck and the
other the shoulder. Fig. 6 shows
clearly how this is done, and when
it is finished a yoke pattern, as in
Fig. 7, is the result. The illustration
gives some idea of the “fit” of a yoke
cut in this way. The girls were very
critical about the neck and shoulder
curves, and the width across the
back and front; many little alterations
were made before the pattern
was considered satisfactory, and good
enough to cut out the material from.</p>

<div class="caption">FINDING THE LENGTH OF THE SLEEVE.</div>
</div>
<p>Having made a satisfactory yoke
pattern, the next thing to tackle was
the sleeve. An oblong piece of paper
was again necessary, and its dimensions
were found in the manner
shown in the two pictures. The
measure was slipped loosely around
the top of the arm, and three or four
inches added to allow for the arm
movement. This gave the width
required, and the length was found
by holding the measure on the top
of the shoulder, as the girl is doing
in the illustration, and then carrying
it around the bent elbow to the wrist.</p>



<div class="figright" style="width: 201px;">
<img src="images/i063c.jpg" width="201" height="273" alt="final arm or rather writst measuring" />
<div class="caption">TAKING THE WRIST MEASUREMENT.</div>
</div>

<p>When this oblong was folded in
half, lengthwise, it faintly resembled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
a sleeve, but, to shape it properly,
two other dimensions were necessary.
The next two photographs show the
girls getting them. The length of
the under-arm sleeve is about three
quarters of the full length, and the
wrist the same fraction of the width
at the top of the arm. The girls
discovered these things for themselves,
and marked with the rounded
end of the scissors, a slightly curved
line from the wrist to the under-arm
position. This double piece was then
cut away.</p>

<p>The shaping of the top of the
sleeve requires a little more judgment
and care. The pattern was opened
out flat, and a convex curve made
from one side to the top, joining
a slightly concave one starting from
the other. Thus they obtained the
foundation of any sleeve pattern.
It can easily be made wider or narrower,
longer or shorter, according
to the dictates of fashion.</p>

<p>As the frock the girls made on this
occasion had sleeves with cuffs, two
or three inches deep, the pattern was
shortened accordingly, before the
material was cut.</p>

<p>The girls were only beginners, so
they cut patterns of the collar and
cuffs in paper, and fitted all the parts
on the material before cutting out.</p>

<p>The cuff and waistband were
straight pieces of material cut to
the required sizes.</p>

<div class="caption">MAKING THE YOKE PATTERN.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Cutting out
the Pattern.</div>

<p>For the collar pattern, the neck
length was taken, as for the yoke
pattern, and an oblong piece of paper
cut out, this length one way and
half of it the other. (See Fig. 1).
This was folded in half to form a
square, and creased across the middle,
as in the diagram. One of the two
open corners was folded over to the
crease, and the triangular pieces thus
formed were cut off, as in Fig. 3. A
curved line was next marked, connecting
one end of the slanting edge,
A, with the bottom end, C, of the
fold. By measuring the length of
the slanting edge A, B, along the
fold, a new point D was found, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
a curve was made parallel to the first
curve, connecting B and D (See
Fig. 4). The double paper was cut
along the curves, and thus the pattern
of half the collar was obtained.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 468px;">
<img src="images/i065.jpg" width="468" height="259" alt="diagram of pattern (five pieces)" />
<div class="caption">MAKING THE COLLAR PATTERN.</div>
</div>

<p>It was found that the collar for the
frock fitted better when made in two
parts and in double material. Thus,
in cutting out the cloth, four pieces,
the size and shape of the pattern,
were required.</p>

<p>The length required for the skirt
was found by fitting on the yoke
pattern, and then measuring from
the middle of the front straight
down, adding two or three inches for
the hem.</p>

<p>The frock in the illustration was
made from double width serge, and
it was found practicable to get the
skirt from one-and-a-half widths, the
other half serving for the yoke.
The pair of sleeves came out of a full
width. This planning and arranging
involved no end of simple but interesting
calculation, and the reality
of it all made a strong appeal to the
girls.</p>

<p>One point of supreme importance
was most carefully impressed—that
was—“the way of the cloth”; certainly,
if this goes wrong, the garment
is ruined, and just as certainly
it is a thing that will never be
mastered “theoretically”—it <i>must</i>
be learnt by actually cutting out of
material.</p>

<p>The cutting of the sleeves from one
pattern is another bit of “practical
politics” which arises when a garment
such as this is being made.
There is no reason why the pair
should not be cut together, so long
as the two right, or two wrong sides
are placed together. The use of
French chalk for marking out the
pattern on the cloth was encouraged.</p>

<p>The making up of the frock
afforded many opportunities for
practice in neat, strong stitching,
combined with beauty. Suitable
cottons and needles were used,
nothing finer than No. 40 cotton will
stand the wear and tear of every-day
life. Where possible, the sewing
machine was used, but the parts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
sewn with it were first carefully
tacked.</p>

<p>The question of decoration aroused
no end of discussion and interest
the whole time the frocks were being
made, and urged many a slow worker
on to greater efforts. The yokes,
cuffs and collars were stitched with
contrasting coloured thread, and the
variety of decoration was delightful.
Simple hand-worked stitches are
generally more effective, as well as
more economical, than bought
trimmings.</p>

<p>Of course, any difficult stitch or
piece of fixing—for example, the
placing of the box pleats—was always
practised on a piece of “scrap”
material or paper, before the frock
was tackled; but when the young
needlewomen realised they were
“trying” a stitch or a piece of fixing,
because they needed to use it in the
making of the frock, they put a good
deal more zest into the work than if
it was a mere “needlework exercise.”
No new material was ever torn up for
these practices—odd bits of any
shape or size were used, and a bag of
such pieces was always at hand, in
sewing lesson, for this purpose.</p>

<p>On the score of both economy and
efficiency, one would plead that the
tearing up of good flannel and calico
for the “sewing lesson” should be
rigidly tabooed. Probably no other
subject offers such unique opportunities
in our schools for inculcating
habits of thrift and economy, with
increased efficiency in the teaching.</p>

<p>The distress of nations, with its
awful promise of misery and poverty
in the future, gives this branch of a
girl’s education an added importance.
Surely we must neglect no
opportunity of improving it!</p>

<h2>The Art of Blouse Making.</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i067.jpg" width="300" height="311" alt="short blouse dark bows at chest, each wrist and waist" />
<div class="caption">The Blouse is fastened with eyelet holes and
ribbon velvet.</div>
</div>

<p>With
an up-to-date
pattern
and
good
material,
the making
of
one’s
own
blouses
is but a
delightful
pastime,
as
well as
a very
profitable
one. The
material
for the
blouse
shown
here cost very little, just a few shillings
would, in fact, pay for the paper
pattern, two yards of the material, a
dozen little bone rings and two yards
of narrow velvet ribbon for the
lacings, but the cost of a similar
blouse ready-made would be at least
four times as much.</p>

<p>The various pieces were all cut out
by a paper pattern, which was pinned
on the material, and on which there
was an allowance of a quarter inch
margin. The collar, cuffs, and yoke
were cut double. The last three items
had their edges all turned inwards,
to the depth of the margin allowed,
then both pieces of each were tacked
together with their edges perfectly
even.</p>

<p>The little turned back cuff had the
two pieces stitched together on the
wrong side on the outer edge and
sides, then turned inside out and the
edges
tacked
flat. The
inside
edge was
tacked in
between
the two
pieces of
the large
cuff and
secured
with a
row of
stitching.</p>

<p>The
sleeves
were
joined
with a
French
seam,
then
both ends were turned into a narrow
hem, which was tacked carefully.
The edge at the lower end was
gathered to fit the cuff with top
stitch set evenly, and for this the
same kind of thread as used in the
faggoting was employed.</p>

<p>The fronts had the edges cased
with a piece of the material for a
depth of two inches. The back was
joined to the fronts in the underarm
seam by a French seam as in the
sleeve, then the entire top portion of
back and front and the armholes
were turned into a narrow hem, and
tacked securely, the front edges
gathered as in the sleeve, to fit the
yoke.</p>

<p>Narrow strips of stiff paper were
tacked underneath the lines where
the different parts were to be joined,
and then the faggoting was commenced
by beginning at the right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
front edge, as shown on this page.</p>

<p>Bring out the thread through the
edge of the yoke, carry it down in a
straight line to top front edge, and
insert the needle down through the
material, bring it out above the
stitch just formed, which you draw
up evenly, now repeat this stitch
through the edge of the yoke one-eighth
of an inch from the first stitch,
and so on from one side to the other.
Make all joining in the thread on the
back of the hem.</p>

<p>When the faggoting is finished,
the hems are worked with a row of
stem stitch, which keeps them in
place and gives a neat finish.</p>

<p>The eyelet holes were next worked,
and the method is shown in the
diagram. Quarter-inch bone rings
are used. Place each in position on
the material and tack around, then
work over in close buttonhole stitch,
having the top of the stitches resting
on the material. The centre of the
eyelet hole is cut away on the back.
The front and cuffs are laced through
these holes, which are set opposite
each other, with narrow velvet.</p>

<p>At the waist line there is a narrow
casing of muslin on the inside, to take
the tape, tie-string or elastic, and the
lower end is neatly hemmed. The
edges of the collar, cuffs, etc., may
have a row of machine, or hand
stitching on the right side, or they
may be joined by stitching on the
wrong side and then turned out.</p>

<h2>Decorative Stitches for Children’s
Clothes.</h2>


<p>How to decorate the simple
garments made at home is a question
one frequently meets.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 323px;">
<img src="images/i069.jpg" width="323" height="544" alt="five types of decorative stiches" />
<div class="caption">SOME PRETTY EFFECTS IN
TACKING STITCH</div>
</div>

<p>Children’s overalls and frocks,
little boys’ tunics, and blouses for
the elder girls, usually need some
trimming or decoration, and it is
often difficult to find just the right
kind. This is especially the case with
coloured garments, and those for
which lace is unsuitable. Many
people like a little embroidery, but it
is not always easy
to get an entirely
suitable pattern.
Some require more
time than the home
worker is able to
give, and some are
more elaborate
than is desirable
for the garment.</p>

<p>A simple kind of
stitchery is usually
resorted to, and
very often meets
the case, and one
may see little
frocks and tunics
of inexpensive
materials, with
quite a note of
distinction given
by the pretty
stitching on the
hems and bands.</p>

<p>The favourite and
most frequently
seen among the
stitches so used,
are the French
knot, stem stitch
and feather stitch.
It is with the idea
of suggesting other
stitches and arrangements,
that these
diagrams and
illustrations are
given, and with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
attention to a very few simple directions,
the most diffident worker may
be sure of a good result.</p>

<p>One feature of decorative stitchery
of this kind, is that it may also be
constructional, that is, that where a
hem is to be decorated, it need not
first be stitched with the machine,
the decoration does the work of the
machine. This point is not always
realised by the
home worker, who
usually makes the
garment with the
sewing machine,
and then proceeds
to decorate it, adding
French knots
and perhaps stem
stitch to hide the
machining.</p>

<p>Some machining
is often necessary,
but much can be
dispensed with,
without detriment
to the garment,
and this makes it
possible to do, at
any rate, part of
the home dressmaking,
away
from the noise and
busy atmosphere
almost inseparable
from a room dominated
by a sewing
machine.</p>

<div class="caption">EFFECTIVE BORDERS FOR
CHILDREN’S FROCKS.</div>
</div>

<p>In making a little
magyar overall,
like that illustrated,
for instance,
the side seams and
opening may be
sewn with a machine,
the hems and
neck prepared as if for machining,
and then the decoration applied. The
home worker, whose husband has a
rooted objection to having a sewing
machine at work when he comes home
in the evening, cuts out and machines
part of her work during the day, and
has only the pleasant part to do by
hand in the evening, while she is free
to talk, or listen to the day’s news.</p>

<p>The worker
who has not
yet used the
tacking
stitch as a
decorative
stitch must be careful on a few points,
however.
The stitch
must not be
too long,

must be as
even as possible.</p>

<p>As a general rule no tacking stitch
used as a decoration should be more
than half-an-inch in length, and the
space between proportionately less.
The space between may be equal to
the stitch, or may be half or a quarter
its length,
but neither
stitch or
space
should be
longer
than half-an-inch,
or
the result may be a
series of long threads,
apt to become loops
if suddenly caught.</p>

<p>For the experiment,
make the stitches
about one-third of an
inch, and the space
between either the
same or very small—about
one-tenth of an
inch. An inch measure
at hand to test the
first few stitches will
quickly help the eye to guess the
correct length of the remainder without
effort. After the first row, the
most difficult part is over, as the
second and succeeding rows will be
exactly the same length.</p>

<h2>The Nursery Casement Curtain.</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 165px;">
<img src="images/i075.jpg" width="165" height="511" alt="pretty crochet insert with roosers and chickens" />
<div class="caption">An Insertion that can be used
lengthwise on a Curtain.</div>
</div>
<p>A very delightful little casement
curtain is shown on <a href="#Page_95">page 95</a>. This
would be eminently suitable for the
Animal and Bird Nursery, and will
appeal to a child; and these little
muslin curtains with filet crochet
tops are so very effective
both from inside
and outside the window.</p>

<p>As will be seen,
the crochet presents
no difficulty, but it
must be done evenly to
look well. A diagram
is given for working
the strip, from which
the open and solid
meshes can be counted.</p>

<p>The heading on the
curtain shown is
worked in Ardern’s
No. 36 cotton. This
measures 15½ inches
wide by 3 inches deep.
To make this a little
longer or deeper, a
coarser cotton could be
used, though, of course,
much depends on the
individual worker as
to the size it actually
works out. But filet
crochet is best done as
closely as possible.</p>

<p>Two of these little
curtains would be wide
enough for some windows,
but it will be
quite easy to repeat the
design, or part of it, if
required. Double crochet
is worked along
the top and bottom of the curtain
strip to give a nice firm edge.</p>

<p>If quite a narrow curtain strip
is preferred, the insertion showing
the two ducks and the rabbit repeated,
would be good. Or this insertion
could be used at the bottom
of a little curtain,
providing there is little
or no fulness in the
curtain. If used at the
bottom of a full curtain,
the design would, of
course, be completely
lost.</p>

<p>This narrower insertion
would also look
very pretty to trim a
white cloth for the tray
or table, and it could
either be let in round
the sides of the cloth, or
a strip would look well
let in across each corner.</p>

<p>The cock and duck insertion
is one that would
be very effective where
a strip is wanted to hang
lengthwise down the
sides of a curtain, or for
any other purpose where
a lengthwise strip is required.

<h2>The Advantage of Coloured
Knitting Cottons.</h2>


<p>Many people do not care for all-white
quilts and bedspreads, considering
them cold-looking, even
though they undoubtedly give a look
of freshness to a bed, when they are
first put on.</p>

<p>And there can be no doubt but
what there is a need for colour in our
furnishings no less than in our dress,
in our dull climate. White bedspreads
look charmingly cool and
refreshing on a hot, sunny July day—but
alas, so few of our days, even
in July, are hot and sunny; and
there are all the other months of the
year to be provided for.</p>

<div class="caption">A BEDSPREAD IN BLUE AND WHITE.</div>
</div>

<p>Hence the vogue of the coloured
bedspread, with its splashes of pink,
or blue, or heliotrope flowers and
green leaves on a white ground.</p>

<p>Now that knitting has returned to
us, and will undoubtedly stay, we
find a revival of the knitted quilt of
our grandmother’s day. But once
more the objection is raised that the
all-white quilt, while undoubtedly
handsome, looks chilly, and shows
every slightest mark.</p>

<p>Few people know what pretty
effects can be obtained from white
knitting combined with colour.
Strutt’s “Milford” Knitting Cotton
comes in several dozen very pretty
shades, all guaranteed to wash well.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Leaf Cluster
Pattern.</div>


<p>The counterpane here illustrated
is in pale blue and white, and is quite
a feature in a pale blue bedroom.</p>

<p>Other colours you can obtain are
various pinks, greens, pale cream, with
the intervening tones right up to full
orange, heliotrope, salmon, half-a-dozen
different blues, from palest
forget-me-not to navy blue, crimson,
fawn, and various tints of brown.</p>

<p>But, undoubtedly, for bedspread
purposes, there is nothing like the
pinks or the blues.</p>

<p>It is best to use patterns that are
worked in separate diamonds or
squares, and joined later on. This
saves a tanglement of various balls,
as is inevitable if several colours are
all going at once on a large piece of
work. When the work is in squares,
each alternate square can be in
colour; when the work is in diamonds,
that begins with one stitch
and increase each row till the widest
point, and then decrease to the
opposite point. Half the diamond is
worked in white, and when the
widest point is reached the cotton is
broken off and the coloured ball
joined on, the remaining half being
worked in colour.</p>

<p>The pattern here illustrated is the
old fashioned leaf-cluster so often
seen in ancient knitted counterpanes.</p>

<p>The bedspread is worked in small
diamonds, which are joined together
by over-sewing.</p>

<h2>The Economy Quilt.</h2>


<p>Bedclothes become an expensive
item when there are several beds for
young people to be made up, as well
as those for their elders. Yet warmth
is essential, if their health is to be
maintained.</p>

<p>In the winter, there usually comes
a night of sudden cold, so raw and so
intense, that it seems next to impossible
to put too much on the beds.
Every spare blanket is turned out,
and every eider-down, and still there
is not enough! Next morning someone
is sure to say they never got
warm all night!</p>

<p>Of course, eider-downs are ideal.
They are warm without being heavy.
But real eider-downs are expensive.
Here is a substitute that was popular
in our grandmothers’ day. It is simply
a quilt formed of small bags, sewn
together like patchwork, each bag
containing a certain amount of snippets
and clippings. Very simple, isn’t
it? And yet these quilts, that cost
practically nothing, are invaluable in
the cold weather. Put one of these
over the outside of the bed, and the
sleeper keeps as snug and warm as
though under a couple of down quilts.</p>

<p>One great advantage of this quilt
is the ease with which it can be made.
A child can always run up a little bag;
a child can also cut up snippets, if it
is old enough to be allowed to use a
scissors. Mother can run round a
few bags with her sewing machine,
just before putting it away after
doing needlework. In this way the
bags accumulate in a surprising
manner; and joining them together,
a few at a time, either by hand or
with the machine, is not laborious or
brain-wearing work.</p>


<p class='sub'>The Method I Always
Adopt.</p>

<p>For some years now, I have made
it a rule always to have one of these
quilts on hand. If I do not need it
myself, when it is finished, I always
know someone who can put it to
good use. Any woman who has an
elastic family and a non-elastic purse,
is glad of one for a gift.</p>

<p>I save every scrap of material that
would otherwise be wasted. If it is
not new, I have it washed and
<i>thoroughly</i> dried. All this waste goes
into a bag that I keep hanging up in
a cupboard in my bedroom. I never
allow a large amount to accumulate,
lest moth should get at it. I have
seldom more than a couple of handfuls
at one time waiting to be dealt
with.</p>

<p>On my chest of drawers I keep a
box. In this there is always a pair of
sharp scissors. When I have a few
moments idle—between the lights
when it is too dark to see much else,
or when my eyes are too tired to do
work requiring close attention—I cut
up a few of the scraps from the bag
into snippets about an inch square<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
sometimes smaller, never larger. I
put these in the box.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Worked in
Sections.</div>

<p>Then again, whenever I have any
bits from dressmaking, or mending,
or darning, it has become second
nature with me to cut them up there
and then into snippets, and put them
in the box. In fact, I always have the
snippet box on the table beside my
work box when I am sewing, and the
bits go in as a matter of course as I
go along. It keeps me so tidy.
Everything comes in useful, even
fragments of darning wool, ravellings
and basting threads!</p>

<p>I save any scraps of material large
enough to make the bags; a useful
size is five or six inches by three
inches. I run up three sides of these
when I have a spare moment; put in
a small handful of snippets, and close
up the end. These I put in a drawer
till I have time to join them together.</p>

<p>I always machine mine together,
as it is the quickest way.</p>

<p>Do not fill the bags anything like
full, or the quilt will be impossibly
heavy. If you fill the bag about a
third full, or at most a very loose
half-full, that will be quite enough.
Each little bag just wants a slight
thickness inside, to give the extra
warmth, much the same as we sometimes
line quilts with a layer of cotton
wool between two cotton covers.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 462px;">
<img src="images/i081.jpg" width="462" height="376" alt="quile of rectangles" />
<div class="caption">SECTION OF THE ECONOMY QUILT.</div>
</div>

<p>The reason we put the clippings in
little bags, instead of into one bag,
is to keep the stuff evenly distributed
over the surface of the bed. Otherwise,
every time the sleeper turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
over, or disarranged the coverings,
there would be the chance of all the
clippings slipping over, and collecting
themselves on the one side or the
other of the bed, or possibly all falling
to the foot of the bed.</p>

<p>A quilt made of the bags, not too
full, can be shaken and kept
thoroughly aired.</p>

<p>Almost any sort of material can be
used for the bags, provided it is not
too delicate in colour, as one does not
want to have a quilt of this sort frequently
going to the cleaners. Strong
stuffs are best, such as cretonne,
serge, stout print, sateen—anything
in fact that will stand some wear.</p>

<p>Mix cotton clippings with wool
clippings in each bag. Obviously the
quilt will not need any lining, as the
back will be fairly neat. If you like,
you can finish the edge with a cord;
but I myself always aim to get the
outside bags all of one colour scheme;
this in itself makes a certain finish—a
kind of border—and I just leave it
at that. After all, these quilts are not
for ornament so much as stern utility;
nevertheless, they can be made to
look really pretty, if a little care and
taste is expended on the placing of
the various colours and designs.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 188px;">
<img src="images/i082.jpg" width="188" height="114" alt="hem stitch for blankets" />
</div>


<p>Turn down a hem
a little more than
½ an inch, having a
ball of wool ready
(Andalusian or 3-ply
white will do),
fasten in the end
with a darning
needle. Having
the working end of wool out at the
top of hem, ready for the crochet hook
(a coarse steel hook is best), catch
up a chain stitch with the hook and
* bring the wool across the hook as
for doing a stitch, insert the hook at
the bottom of hem, catch wool on
opposite side, the opposite way to
lifting the thread
as in crocheting,
that is hooking the
wool in a downward
movement
from right to left,
draw loop through
and up level with
the top of line.
Take out the hook and make one loop,
just drawn up to lie in two straight
lines and slip through loop on
needle, afterwards doing a chain
stitch, and repeat from *. A little
practice will soon show that done in
this way the stitches are not twisted
but lay flat, like the machine finish.</p>

<h2>Doing up an Eiderdown.</h2>


<p>In the days of our grandmothers,
eiderdowns were
considered a luxury, things
to be taken care of and
kept well covered. At the
present time, however, they
are found on nearly every
bed, varying from those
made of sateen and chintz
to those made of satin and
silk.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 123px;">
<img src="images/i083.jpg" width="123" height="664" alt="crochet insertion of ducks and bunnies" />
<div class="caption">A NARROW INSERTION
FOR A NURSERY
CASEMENT CURTAIN.<br />

See the article
on <a href="#Page_67">page 67</a>.</div>
</div>
<p>I suppose it is because
“familiarity breeds contempt”
that we do not take
the care of ours that our
grandmothers did of theirs,
and that therefore they
became so much sooner
soiled and worn out. If
your eiderdown is getting
shabby, why not clean it
and re-cover it yourself?</p>

<p>If anybody is not willing
to give up a little time and
trouble to the success of
this venture, let them not
so much as contemplate
cleaning and re-covering an
eiderdown at home, for
though quite easy it is a
little tiresome, and the only
two things really needed
outside a few yards of
chintz are patience and
common sense. To explain:
patience will be
needed, for an eiderdown
takes some time to dry
when once wet, and common
sense to choose the right
day on which to do it.</p>

<p>The first thing to do is to
choose a hot day, as the
eiderdown must be dried
out-of-doors, and the
brighter the day the quicker
it will dry, added to which
the sunshine fluffs up the
down better than any fire
does.</p>

<p>After well brushing and
shaking the quilt, whip it
well with a little cane to
loosen the feathers and to
get out whatever dust you
can. Have ready a bath
half full of warm—not hot—water,
into which dissolve a
small packet of Lux. Be
sure before putting the quilt
in that the soap is well
melted, as otherwise it is
apt to stick in lumps to the
covering, whatever it
may be.</p>

<p>Dip half of the quilt in
first and souse it up and
down before dipping in the
rest. You will be surprised
at the amount of dirt that
“pours” out. It seems incredible
that an eiderdown
could be so dirty without
showing it plainly.</p>

<p>When the whole quilt is
wet, continue to dip it up
and down in the water for
some time, gently squeezing
it between your hands. It
does not matter if the colour
runs, as the dye will not
affect the down, and as you
are re-covering it, why, the
streaky case will not be
seen.</p>

<p>Let it soak in the water
for about an hour, occasionally
stirring it in the bath,
kneading and squeezing it
so as to loosen the dirt.
When you think it is clean,
empty the bath and refill
with hotter water, but no
soap. Rinse well and continue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
in fresh waters until
the soap is completely
rinsed out.</p>

<p>Wring out thoroughly
and hang over the edge of
the bath to drain. At the
end of twenty minutes
wring out again, and it is
much better if you can get
another person to help
with it, as it is much too
big to do alone. Next,
take it out into the garden
and hang it on a line, the
higher the better, but anywhere
where the wind can
blow through it.</p>

<p>And here is needed the
patience; for it will take
two days—probably three
days, and possibly a <i>week</i>—to
dry in the open, for
an eiderdown is very
thick, and the down being
close it is difficult for the
air to penetrate. Never
let it stay out after the
sun is off it, as it quickly
absorbs the damp and
only delays the process of
drying. Frequently turn
it while hanging on the
line, and shake it well to
loosen the feathers.</p>

<p>I generally find that
three days is enough to
dry my quilts thoroughly,
but I always leave them
spread out on the grass on
a clean sheet for one whole
day in the sunshine after
the drying to fluff up the
feathers. It is wonderful
how the heat makes them
swell and become light
and fluffy.</p>

<div class="caption">A DIAGRAM FOR THE
CASEMENT CURTAIN
SHOWN ON <a href="#Page_95">PAGE 95</a>.</div>
</div>

<p>When all this is finished,
take your little cane and
whip it all over hard, as
though you were beating
a carpet. Turn it often
as this helps to loosen the
down inside.</p>

<p>This completes the
cleaning process, which is
simple but complete, and
then you are ready for the
re-covering.</p>

<p>The new cover, needless
to say, depends entirely
upon individual choice
whether it is to be satin,
silk, sateen or chintz.</p>

<p>I always use a pretty
chintz corresponding to
the curtains and hangings
of the bedroom the quilt
belongs to. One side I
cover with this, and the
other side I use a self-coloured
sateen or casement
cloth to tone.</p>

<p>It is impossible for me
to give the amount of
material necessary, as
eiderdowns vary tremendously
in size. There are
many different widths in
what is called a double-bedded
quilt, as also in
the single-bedded ones.
For large-sized ones you
will have to have a seam
down the centre, as no
material is wide enough to
cover it completely; but,
for a single-width quilt, a
forty-inch goods will be
wide enough.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
Re-covering the
Quilt.</div>

<p>The last quilt I covered
was for a brown room
with a china-blue carpet
patterned in white,
and so I chose a willow-pattern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
chintz with a reverse side of
brown sateen, and it was really one
of the most successful I have done.</p>

<p>First of all, machine-stitch the
two widths of material together,
being careful to match the design
on the right side, and carefully
press the seam flat. Then spread
out on the floor the sateen—also
seamed—and, laying the eiderdown
upon it, run a tacking thread all
round the edge, being careful to
stretch the quilt to its fullest, so as
not to make the cover too tight.
After this run a line of stitching
around each and every little eyelet,
of which there are many; these hold
the cover in position for the next
step.</p>

<p>Taking a long thread of a bright-coloured
cotton, carefully follow out
the design of the quilting, which,
in my particular case, was a very
elaborate scroll, tacking the stitches
right through the quilt to the new
piece of material. If the design is
very complicated this needs patience;
but nowadays eiderdowns are
more often quilted in straight lines,
with perhaps a diamond centre.</p>

<p>Always tack your pattern on the
plain side of the material, as it is
so much easier to stitch on the
machine later on if there is no pattern
to dazzle your eyes.</p>

<p>I would impress on whoever tries
this re-covering to be <i>very</i> careful
about keeping exactly to the quilting
pattern, as on this altogether
depends the success of the whole
undertaking. It would be most disappointing
if, after having finished,
you should find that owing to careless
tacking the covering was
crooked or cramped or drawn. It
takes patience and care, but is quite
easy and most satisfying.</p>

<p>When you have completed the outlining,
lay the quilt on the floor
again and tack on the chintz, doing
exactly as you did with the sateen,
only omitting to outline the quilting,
as it is not necessary to have
it on both sides.</p>

<p>Next, where the threads outline
the eyelets take a stiletto and punch
the holes through both sides and
button-hole them all round through
the double materials. In doing this
use silk the colour of the plain-coloured
side, as it looks so much
nicer than the reverse way.</p>

<p>And now all is ready for the
machine. If your quilt is in two
colours, thread the machine with
the silk matching the sateen and
use a bobbin threaded with a shade
to match the reverse. Carefully follow
out the design which you have
outlined, spreading the quilt as
wide as possible so as not to get it
puckered.</p>

<p>When all the stitching is finished
you will be delighted to see that
both sides of the quilt are stitched
in their own respective colourings.</p>

<p>Take out the tacking threads
around the edge, and turning down
the edge of the “right side” of the
quilt insert a narrow piping cord
and sew in by machine. Next turn
in the edges of the other side, and
hem by hand down to the edge of
the cord. This gives a very nice
finish as well as a very neat one.</p>

<p>To anybody who desires a frill,
though these are not always the prevailing
fashion—there being fashions
in eiderdowns as in other things—after
taking out the tacking thread
around the edge of the quilt, insert
the frill instead of the cord and
stitch firmly by machine. In using
a frill be sure to have it made of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
the two materials the same as the
cover, putting the plain to the plain
and the fancy to the fancy. Then
hem down as with the cord.</p>

<p>A very handsome edge can be
made if a thick cord be used similar
to those used in upholstery
work, but covered tightly with
material before sewing to the cover.
The pulling tightly of the material
covering the cord gives a sort of
“cable” effect, and is really very
pretty.</p>

<p>When completed I feel sure you
will be pleased with the look of
your new eiderdown. It costs so
little—not more than a few shillings
at the outside.</p>

<h2>Patchwork Quilts.</h2>


<p>That useful branch of oldtime
needlework, the patchwork quilt,
has been revived, and this revival is
due to the exigency of economy
during war-time. The price of all
kinds of materials being so very high,
and the need for economy so great,
have led to many useful devices, in
order to maintain a reasonable
amount of comfort during these
trying times, and not the least of
these is the patchwork quilt.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 198px;">
<img src="images/i087a.jpg" width="198" height="164" alt="quilt of triangles" />
<div class="caption">A simple pattern showing triangles in three
colours.</div>
</div>

<p>The smallest scraps of cotton, silk,
or other material can be utilised and
made into coverings, which in many
cases may be made very artistic, and
durable. In order to carry out the
colour scheme of the bedroom for
which it is intended, it is necessary
to combine only those colours which
are found in the other furnishings.</p>

<p>The usual size of a quilt for a double
bed is 6 ft. by 5 ft., or if the bed be
very large, 6 ft. by 6 ft. The single
bed size is 5 ft. by 4 ft. For a child’s
cot, 4 ft. by 3 ft. is the average size.</p>

<div class="caption">To form the sides of the padded quilt
illustrated on the next page.</div>
</div>

<p>Many of the more artistic kind
are made up into bedspread size,
which is longer than the quilt, and
allows for a fall over each side. The
size of a bedspread is usually from
72 to 90 inches, by from 90 to 100
inches.</p>

<div class="caption">An effective design for silk patchwork: black
and white squares, machined or quilted
diagonally in green.</div>
</div>

<p>The pieces of material, which are
all of the same kind in each quilt,
are cut up into triangles, squares,
points, circles, etc., and care must be
taken to have the sizes of the different
shapes exactly alike. The edges are
turned in, then the various pieces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
topsewn together on
the wrong side
according to the pattern.
It is a good
plan to make the
quilt in sections,
then unite all together.</p>

<div class="caption">A diagram showing a two-colour star design.</div>
</div>

<p>A quilt of this
kind must have a
lining, and if wanted
to give additional
warmth an interlining
of some kind.
Cotton wadding,
strips of old white
flannel, or any
colour which will
not run in the washing,
sewn together.
Old woollen underwear
<i>thoroughly</i>
washed and with worn pieces cut
away, can be made use of, as well as
light colour tweeds, etc., but all
pieces must be lightly sewn together
with flat seams, then tacked on the
lining. See that this lining fits the
quilt exactly, turn in the edges of
both, tack together, then machine
stitch or sew the
edges together.
Blanket stitch
may be worked
over the edge
with coarse coloured
silk, embroidery
thread,
or No. 5 “Peri-Lusta.”</p>

<div class="caption">To form a padded quilt.</div>
</div>

<p>The quilt is
now ready for the
“quilting,” without
which it
would not be
complete. This
is done on the
sewing machine
if one be at hand,
otherwise hand-sewing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
with coloured thread, matching
or contrasting with the work, is
done in running stitch, with here and
there a backstitch to make it secure.
Use a long sewing needle with “Peri-Lusta”
thread, any required colour,
No. 8. The lines of sewing can be
formed into diamond shape, squares,
herringbone shape, zig-zag, or any
other form liked.</p>

<div class="sidenote">About
Quilting.</div>

<p>The following designs are easily
made, and will only require scraps
of material found lying idle in most
households. Old sheets can be made
use of for the lining, or perhaps
faded casement curtains, which can
be washed and bleached, or tinted to
match.</p>

<div class="caption">An appliqué design to border a plain bedspread. This was
carried out in two shades of blue.</div>
</div>


<p class='sub'>Triangles in Three
Colours.</p>

<p>This is intended for scraps of silk
too small to allow of variety in the
shape. They are all cut into triangles,
and the colours arranged to form
hexagonal shapes. There are only
three colours, and of each you will
require two triangles to form the
hexagonal shape. Place the six triangles
with a point of each in the
centre, no two of same colour coming
together, turn in and topsew the
edges of each of two sides together.
Make several of this shape before
joining together, then topsew all the
hexagonals, which will be found to
fit into each other. Finish in the
manner already directed.</p>


<p class='sub'>A Variety of the
“Star” Shape Design.</p>

<p>The design shown on page 82 is a
variety of the “star” shape design,
and three colours are used. Each
star has a plain six-sided figure in
the centre. In the design this centre
is green. Then each of these six
sides has a triangle in white. The
space between the points being filled
with pink, the outer edge of which
is, of course, twice
as long as one side
of the centre.</p>


<p class='sub'>Suitable for Silk
Patchwork.</p>

<p>The design at the
bottom of page 79
is the very latest
design, and is suitable
for scraps of
silk, the fashionable
colours of black and
white being combined
in the sample.
Blue and white, pink
and white, green
and white, or any
other colours can be
substituted. The
border has an
appliqué of roses
cut from cretonne.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Each motif has
its edges turned
under, then
tacked to the
quilt or bedspread
when the
quilting is
finished. The
edge is worked
over with green
“Peri-Lusta” of
the same shade as
that with which
the “quilting”
was done, using
outline stitch.</p>


<p class='sub'>To Form a Padded
Quilt.</p>

<p>The design at the bottom of page
80 is intended for forming a padded
quilt out of small pieces of silk,
sateen, or other material. The
hexagonal shape is used here, and
the lining of contrasting colour is
cut to the same size, then five sides
of the shape are sewn together, and
the little bag so formed is stuffed
with vegetable down, then the other
side sewn up. One side of this can
be silk and the other cotton.</p>

<p>The long narrow strips for the sides
are formed of the principal material
in strips of the required length, and
double the width the band is to be.
Sew the edges together, then stuff
with the down through one end, sew
the corners together, and these must
be cut at right angles, so as to give a
nice corner. When all the padded
pieces are sewn together, a pretty
effect is obtained by going over all
the seams with black cotton in
feather-stitch. Vegetable down is
cheap, and about three pounds will
be ample for a large size quilt.</p>

<div class="caption">A three-colour design for a patch-work quilt, in diamonds,
triangles, and hexagonals.</div>
</div>


<p class='sub'>Patchwork Appliqué
Bedspreads.</p>

<p>Another economical bed-covering
is found in the patchwork appliqué.
In this bedspread there is no lining
required, and cheap cotton material
serves for the foundation, or old
sheets, casement curtains, bolton
sheeting, etc., that have served their
purpose can be utilised. They can
be tinted any shade desirable and, of
course, must contrast with the colours
chosen for the appliqué. A deep
border turned up on the foundation
in the form of a hem is attractive, as
seen in the “Fleur-de-lis” design on
<a href="#Page_81">page 81</a>. Here the foundation is
cream sateen, and the appliqué with
border cut from similar material, but
in a deep shade of pink. The motif
is simply outlined with black “Peri-Lusta”
in stem stitch, when attaching
to the bedspread.</p>

<p>Now more than ever is it absolutely
necessary to preserve our linen
household napery, for the price asked
for new linen is enormous, owing to
its scarcity, and it is said that in the
near future it will be almost impossible
to obtain it at any price.</p>

<p>It may not be generally known that
linen is liable to the attack of minute
insects, which bore through it, just
as the moth does through wood, and
so weaken it that it soon wears into
holes, if precaution is not taken to
prevent them. When storing linen,
camphor, lavender, cedar wood, etc.,
are just as necessary for its preservation
as they are for woollen goods,
and it is said that an apple, hung up
till quite dry, then studded all over
with cloves, stuck in up to the head,
is very potent when attached to the
top of the drawer of the chest, or
hung on the inside of the door, if
the chest be made in this way. All
linen should be well aired before
putting away. The repairs should be
made before sending the linen to the
laundry, and if it has been stiffened
and glazed, the part requiring mending
should be steeped in warm water
to take out the starch, and then
dried.</p>

<p>When a part becomes threadbare,
the best method of repairing is to
darn it neatly with fine linen thread,
obtained by ravelling a piece of the
material. In the case of a table
cloth this thread can be got by ripping
the hem at one end and unravelling
the edge for a few rows.
Wind the thread on a reel and keep
for the repairing of this cloth, then
remake the hem.</p>

<p>Fig. 1 shows the method of doing
plain darning, and Fig. 2 shows the
twill darning or plain damask stitch.</p>

<p>Insert the part to be darned in the
embroidery tambour with the wrong
side turned towards you, as all darning
must be done on this side of the
material. The darning should go
well up into the sound part of the
surrounding material, and the stitches
should be small and even.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Repairing Table
Linen.</div>

<p>Run in the lengthwise stitches
first, taking care to have them a
little loose, as they will shrink when
washed, and leave a small loop of the
thread at each turning, to allow for
the taking up of these threads when
working across them. Run the
stitches according to the thread of
the material in perfectly straight
lines, taking up only two or three
threads and skipping the same
number. In alternate rows take up
those threads skipped in the preceding
rows.</p>

<p>When the weak portion is covered
with the lengthwise stitches and
about half an inch beyond it at each
end, work across in the same way,
taking up and leaving alternate
stitches, and having the same space
between the rows as at first.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 449px;">

<div class="caption">These specimens show some of the patterns that are to be met with in damask.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Darning and

<p>When there is a hole in the linen,
it is necessary to cut away the worn
edges and make the sides even, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
darn as in the preceding case, but
have the threads much closer
together, continue each lengthwise
thread across the hole and darn down
below it, leave the loop at the end
when turning. (See Fig. 1). The
darn when finished should have the
threads so close together as to replace
the original piece.</p>

<p>For twilled linen fabric Fig. 2
shows the method of proceeding.
Begin by working the darning stitch
lengthwise across the hole in the same
manner as before, then study the
material to see how many threads of
the fabric are crossed over to form
the twill, and proceed to make the
crossing stitches, passing over two
or three threads and taking up one
or two according to the pattern. In
each succeeding row advance one or
two threads in the same direction.</p>

<p>Even coloured borders can be very
successfully repaired, and a correct
copy of the original design be obtained
in this way, using thread matching
in colour with those of the border.</p>

<p>Fig. 3 shows how to repair a rent
in the material, or a gash made by a
knife, when the edges fit close
together. Place a strip of stiff paper
underneath the opening and tack
securely all round. Darn across the
rent, drawing the edges close
together, and picking up the threads
in each row which were passed over
in the preceding. Leave the small
loop at each turning as before.</p>

<p class='sub'>Patching the Linen.</p>

<p>When the piece to be repaired is
too large for darning, it must be cut
out and replaced with a patch of the
same material and, if possible, the
patch should be cut from linen which
has been in use about the same length
of time as that requiring the mending.
If new material must be used,
then let it be somewhat thinner in
texture than the other, for if the
same material in a new piece be used
the patch would be very conspicuous.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Repairing Table
Linen.</div>

<p>Use fine linen thread and a fine
sewing needle when patching. Cut
the edges of the hole to a thread
of the material, taking away the
worn parts completely, cut the patch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
to fit over the hole and about an inch
beyond it each way. Turn in the
edges of the hole, making a diagonal
slit at each corner, to get a perfect
angle and flat seam. Turn in the
edges of the patch and tack on the
wrong side evenly over the hole, turn
to the right side and hem the patch
to the edge of the hole with neat
small stitches, then backstitch on
this right side to the outside edge of
the patch, keeping the lines straight
and the angle at each corner acute.
See Fig. 4.</p>

<p>Fig. 5 shows the inset patch which
is less noticeable than the preceding,
and suitable for articles which do not
have to stand very frequent use and
washing. The edges of the hole are
arranged as in the preceding, the
patch is cut to fit it exactly, with its
edges turned in a seam of the same
width as that in the hole. Both
edges are topsewn together on the
wrong side, then the seam opened
out and pressed quite flat. If neatly
done and the pattern evenly matched,
a patch of this kind is scarcely noticeable.
The raw edges of the material
should be neatly overcast to prevent
ravelling.</p>


<p class='sub'>Darning Damask
Table Linen.</p>

<p>When darning damask linen it is
quite possible to imitate the design
so closely as to render the mending
invisible. A close study of the design
is necessary to see the number of
threads taken up and passed over.
In all cases the best thread to use is
the ravelling obtained by picking
out the threads from the edges of
the material.</p>

<p>The illustration page shows the
most common damask patterns and
the method of darning them. In all
cases the lengthwise stitches are
worked as in Fig. 2. The pattern is
worked by the crossing stitches,
taking up and passing over a certain
number of threads in each successive
row.</p>

<p>The samples are worked with two
coloured threads, so that the stitches
forming the design can be easily
copied.</p>

<p>When doing drawn thread work
wind all the pulled threads on a reel,
and keep them for mending linen of
all kinds, they are the best threads
for the purpose.</p>


<p class='sub'>When Cloths are frayed
at the Laundry.</p>

<p>Table cloths and serviettes are
usually sent to the laundry, even
when the bulk of the washing is
done at home, as it is so difficult for
the amateur to get the evenly glazed
surface that the professional worker
gives the cloths. The result is that
tablecloths soon show signs of wear
and tear, and invariably “go” first
down the edges.</p>

<p>As soon as holes and fraying appear
at the sides or ends, cut the strip
right off, unless it is quite a small
rent and can easily be mended. As a
rule, when the edges once start to
go, they do the job pretty thoroughly.
And the best way is to cut off the
weak part, before it tears far into
the material, and turn a new hem.</p>

<p>If the cloth is then too narrow to
use on the dining table, it can be
widened or lengthened, by applying
a deep hem, which can be joined
with fagotting to the cloth. It will
be necessary to tack both the cloth
that has been cut and re-hemmed,
and the new hem on stiff paper to
keep it even as you work the
faggoting.</p>

<h2>Mending a Sheet.</h2>

<div class="caption">Showing the centre of the sheet with selvedge edges
in overlapping seam, and hem-stitching reworked
over the seam.</div>
</div>

<p>Nowadays, when economy must
be the watchword with most of us,
a great saving can be effected in our
household by paying attention to
the requirements of the contents of
the linen chest and remembering
the old proverb, “a stitch in time
saves nine.”</p>

<p>When a piece of bedroom or table-napery
shows signs of wear in any
part by becoming thin, patching can
be avoided
by carefully
darning the
spot with soft
cotton or linen
thread, running
the stitches
well up
into the sound
portion surrounding
the
weak. But
when, as in
the case of
sheets, a large
portion gets
thin all over,
patching must
be resorted to.</p>

<p>The best
way to repair
a sheet that
has become
well worn in
the centre is
to cut it right
up the middle
and turn the
selvedged
edges to the
centre. Tack
these in a flat
seam, overlapping
the
edges for
somewhat less than the quarter of
an inch (do not turn in the selvedge
edge for there must not be a thick
seam), using fine sewing cotton of a
soft make, stitch along the extreme
edge of the seam at both sides, or use
the machine if one be handy; in the
latter case do not have the tension
tight. If the part now turned to
the sides shows any holes or any
portion of it be very thin, it is better
to cut this
portion out
and replace
by a patch.</p>

<p>The piece
for this patch
should be
lighter than
the material
of the sheet,
but of the
same kind,
and it is always
well to
keep pieces of
the old sheets
which can no
longer be used
for this purpose.</p>

<p>Cut the
patch to the
required size
by a line in
the threads of
the material,
allowing two
or three inches
beyond
the weak
edges in the
sheet. Turn
in the edges
neatly along
the three sides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
of the piece which come in on the
sheet, tack the two edges together
and spread the patch in place on the
sheet, making it perfectly smooth,
now tack round the three edges.
Hem down this side of the patch.</p>

</div>

<p>Turn the other side of the sheet
and cut away the portion over the
patch, leaving half an inch margin,
turn in the edges of the margin,
snipping the corners to make an
angle, tack the seam, then hem or
machine-stitch along the edge.
The sheet is now ready for hemming
the sides, turn in a half inch hem at
each side and sew in place. If the
sheet has been hem-stitched at both
ends a few stitches of this hemming
must be undone at each side of the
centre seam and then reworked so
as to preserve the pattern and give
a neat finish to the work.</p>

<h2>A Patchwork Toilet Runner.</h2>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/i097.jpg" width="450" height="245" alt="black and white photograph" />
<div class="caption">Strips of pretty Cretonne are joined together, and
the hem is of blue print.</div>
</div>


<p>The illustration on this page shows
a very effective way of using pieces
of cretonne to make a toilet runner.
Runners are expensive items to buy,
but if you have some pretty pieces of
material by you, you can make one
with very little trouble and expense.</p>

<p>The one shown is composed of
18 pieces of pretty coloured cretonne,
each measuring about 2¼ × 8¼ inches.
These are joined together to make a
long strip, and the whole is finished
with a 1¾ inch hem of blue print,
which is machined on.</p>

<p>The border can be of any pretty
shade that will tone well with the
pieces. Or, if they are of a delicate
shade, a hem of unbleached calico
would make a delightful finish. This
washes excellently, and the soft,
creamy tint looks exceedingly well
with the pale-coloured pieces.</p>

<p>In selecting the pieces of cretonne
to be used, it is essential to employ
only those that will launder well.
Otherwise with the first wash the
whole thing will be spoilt through
the colours “running.”</p>

<p>This runner when finished
measures 44 inches long by 12 inches
deep, but a cloth of any size or shape
can be made in this way, and with
a little thought and trouble really
delightful results can be secured at
little or no expense.</p>

<p>If you do not happen to have any
fancy cretonne by you, there is no
reason why plain coloured pieces
should not be used. So long as they
are carefully and tastefully blended,
quite a pretty cloth or runner can be
made. Oddments of casement cloth,
linen, cotton poplin, print, can all
be saved, and a real economy can be
effected by this method of using
them.</p>

<h2>Modern Bead Work.</h2>


<p>Beaded motifs
as dress trimmings
were
never more in
vogue than at
the present
time. Beaded
bags, hat-bands,
belts and ornaments
are all
expensive articles
to purchase,
but they are
quite easy to
make, and the
materials cost
but a little.</p>

<p>There are two modes of making
the hand-made trimmings and bags,
and, of course, this kind is worth
much more than that made by
machinery, as well as being more
lasting and artistic.</p>

<p>In beaded crochet a coloured mercerised
cotton, fine enough to pass
easily through the beads selected,
is used with a crochet-hook corresponding
in fineness to the thread.
The beads are first put on the thread,
using a fine sewing needle for the
purpose, or waxing the thread end;
the beads are then worked into the
design with the usual d&nbsp;c.</p>

<p>In the needle-made variety, which
we are illustrating in this issue, each
bead is attached to the bead immediately
below it, and to the one following
it. A very fine sewing needle,
with fine linen or glazed cotton
thread, is necessary.</p>


<p class='sub'>The Rose
Design.</p>

<div class="caption">A Needle-made Beaded Rose Motif</div>
</div>

<p>This beautiful design is suitable as
a single motif for dress trimming, or
as a repeat for tops of bags, etc.</p>

<p>Delft-blue china beads compose
the background
for the rose,
which is of a
deep pink
colour, with
small green
stem.</p>

<p>Use fine linen
thread and a
very fine sewing
needle. Thread
29 of the blue
beads (or any
other colour
selected for the
groundwork),
run the needle back through the 28th
bead (that is, insert the needle
through the 28th bead, between the
28th and 29th, and bring it out
through the 28th between that and
the 27th), thread a bead, bring this
bead over the 28th, and run the
needle back through the 28th, as you
did before, but run it through the
27th also; thread another bead, place
it over the 27th, and run the needle
back through the 27th and 26th
beads; repeat with every 2 beads to
the end. Turn.</p>

needle back through the last bead in

2nd row, introducing the rose beads.

<p class='sub'>The Bird
Motif.</p>

<p>This is worked with two shades of
blue beads—light and dark—bright
yellow, and any colour chosen for
the ground-work.</p>

<p>It is a beautiful design for a beaded
bag intended for a gift. If used for
this purpose there must be a larger
number of beads in the first row for
a foundation, as the number shown
in the diagram (52) only gives a
width of 4 inches. Allow 14 beads
for each extra inch required. Be
sure to keep the bird design exactly
in the centre of the background,
the depth of the design as worked is
3¼ inches, therefore more rows before
and after the bird design will be
necessary to increase the depth.</p>

<p>Using a fine linen or glazed sewing
cotton, thread 53 beads for the
groundwork foundation, turn, run
the thread back through the 52nd
bead, and, working as directed for
the rose design, form the 2nd row of
groundwork, which, in the illustration
is white. The “turning” bead
is not included in the numbers composing
the design, but it must be
used at the beginning of every row.</p>

worker can easily gauge
what width pattern she

are so varied in design as

If a firm, close pattern is
preferred, either No. 1 or
No. 2 would be suitable,
the latter being particularly
strong, the padding
cord giving extra durability.</p>

<p>For an easily and quickly
worked pattern, it would
be difficult to find anything
to beat design No. 5.
This has the very even
flat appearance, which
renders it particularly
suitable for ribbon purposes.
Similar in appearance,
though somewhat
different in the working,
is No. 7.</p>

<p>No. 8 is a very lacy pattern,
particularly suitable
for finer kinds of underwear.</p>

<h2>Bead Fancies.</h2>


<p>The fashion of the present day
runs towards beads in every colour
and design, and although the making
of beads is not exactly a needlework
economy, it is a dress economy,
and that is very nearly related
to needlework.</p>

<p>I have been very successful in
making all sorts of articles for
ornamentation—from beads, sealing-wax,
broken china, a little gold
paint and some glue, not to mention
a little grease and a knitting-needle.</p>

<p>I began my home-made bead-making
from necessity, because I
was unable to find any beads to
match a particular frock I very
much wanted a string for. Also, in
hunting everywhere for them, I
found that the really artistic and
barbaric ones ran into a great deal
of money, especially if they were
large.</p>

<p>Now I wanted an odd shade of
blue, which was really no shade at
all, because the material was old
and had faded to the beautiful tint
which it now possesses. I could not
procure any that were even remotely
like it, and so my idea of making
some for myself was born.</p>

<p>To begin with, I bought for sixpence
a large box of assorted beads,
such as are sold for children to
string at kindergarten.</p>


<p class='sub'>Sealing-wax is
an Essential.</p>

<p>At a stationer’s I bought up a
whole lot of broken sealing-wax for
a very little money, purchasing at
the same time two good sticks, one
of gold and one of silver. These I
carried home and sorted as best I
could into shades of different
colouring.</p>

<p>You will be surprised to find
what a lot of different tones there
are to be had in sealing-wax,
though, when buying, be careful not
to be taken in by the outside of the
stick! I bought what I thought was
a beautiful shade of lavender, but
fortunately was told by the assistant
that it was really a dark blue,
which had been in the window and
faded! Blues will often fade
mauve, and reds will become pink.
But you will easily avoid mistakes
by looking at the box which gives
a description of its contents.</p>


<p class='sub'>Broken China the
next Requisite.</p>

<p>Having secured what I wanted
at the stationer’s, I next looked
through the china pantry and kitchen
cupboards to see what I could
find in the way of broken china and
glass.</p>

<p>I turned out quite a nice little
heap from here, and then went to
the tool-house, where I had a little
store, which I had dug up out of
the garden.</p>

<p>I never can understand where all
the broken china comes from which
is always to be found in every garden
when the earth is turned up. I
have a small basket full of all sorts,
of odd pieces in bright blues, reds,
and yellows, which appear to be
chips from plates or saucers. I
should think it would take a generation
of families, and their tea,
dinner and breakfast services, to
account for the quantity and colouring
I have by me.</p>

<p>All this china I washed carefully
in soapy water, rinsing in very
hot clear water, and drying whilst
still hot. By this means the china
and glass keeps its shine, and if set
in the sun for a little while it will
greatly improve the lustre.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>Next I sorted the colours, and
then, with the aid of a wooden hammer
and a piece of felt, I cracked
the china into tiny pieces. Be careful
in doing this to put the coloured
side of the china downwards, and
lay on a piece of felt, with another
piece on top. Hit gently, but
firmly, and where the piece is
cracked insert a nail or strong pin
in the crack and hit with the hammer.
The cracks will split and will
leave a nice edge, which is very
useful for sticking in the sealing-wax.
Break the pieces as small as
possible, but leaving the colour to
show on one side. If you smash at
the pieces they will powder and be
of no use at all.</p>

the other side in

</div>

<p>Whatever odd beads you have, or
old pieces of coloured paste and
imitation stones—which are often to
be had in old buckles—spangles
and bugles, all are grist to the mill.
I have also used broken pieces of
pebbles and stones which I found
among the gravel, and which were
broken by the roller, and which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
when chipped very fine, displayed
really brilliant colouring. Pieces of
flint with a sparkle of mica look
beautiful.</p>


<p class='sub'>Making the
Beads.</p>

<p>Having completed this collection,
I turned my attention to the bead-making,
and I began in this
manner:—</p>

<p>I started with a set of six large
beads in blues for my chain. I
chose the largest beads in my assorted
box, irrespective of colour
and shape. Taking one of these I
slipped it over the end of a steel
knitting-needle, using one large
enough to hold the bead tightly.
This needle I first greased with a
rag on which a little lard had been
rubbed. This prevents the sealing-wax
adhering to anything but the
bead.</p>

<p>Next I lit a taper, and, using blue
wax, I covered the bead roughly
with it, turning the knitting-needle
in my hand, so that the hot liquid
ran round it. This I plunged into
cold water.</p>

<p>Before proceeding, I would like to
say that great care must be taken
not to smoke the wax when a taper
or candle is used; if you will heat
the wax in the centre of the flame,
you will find that the colour does
not become blackened.</p>

<p>As soon as the blue wax had
cooled, without hardening, I splashed
on some of the gold, and, turning
the bead rapidly in the flame itself,
the gold mingled with the blue, so
forming a sort of marbled effect.
This I also plunged into the cold
water.</p>

<p>Then I chose a brilliant yellow
wax, and, heating it in the candle
flame, I squeezed the tip into a
sharp point.</p>

<p>This, in turn, I heated, and
dabbed it in regular intervals round
the bead to form spots. While the
spots were still soft, I pushed into
the centre of each one a tiny piece
of broken china, in a pure turquoise
shade, pinching the wax to cover
the rough edge.</p>

<p>Do not use the fingers to the
sealing-wax more than can be possibly
helped, as touching it takes
away the glaze.</p>

<p>I made three beads similar to this
design, and three in a paler shade
of blue, with the same yellow spots,
but using pieces of dark red china
instead of the turquoise. These I
strung with a three-inch length of
small yellow beads (which I bought
at the same shop as the box of
beads came from, and which were
also sold for children’s kindergarten
work) between each large one, and
the chain, when finished, looked
truly beautiful. It certainly enhanced
the beauty and value of the
frock for which it was made.</p>


<p class='sub'>Making Fancy
Buttons.</p>

<p>To match the chain I made four
buttons, used to fasten the shoulder-pieces
of the bodice, in the same
colours and the same design.</p>

<p>To make these, any old buttons
that have shanks to them will do,
but have shanks they must, as there
is no other means of fastening
them. I had four old brass buttons,
with flat, shiny tops. With an old
knife I scraped the face of each so
as to make it rough, as the wax
adheres better to a rough surface.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pretty Uses
for Beads.</div>

<p>I used a piece of cardboard—piece
of an old box—and cut four
small slits in it large enough to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
slip the button-shanks through. On
the other side I slipped a burnt
match into the shank of each, and
by this means the buttons were
quite firm and did not wobble about.</p>

<p>Then I covered two with dark
wax, and two with light wax similar
to the beads, scraping away any
wax which had overflowed on to the
cardboard. Before it was cold I
pressed a tiny ring of the small
yellow beads round the immediate
edge, finishing off with a spot of
the yellow wax in the centre of
each, and a scrap of broken china
in the centre of that, again.</p>

<p>I found the buttons a little rough
on the edge, but, with the aid of a
nail file, I rubbed them fairly
smooth, and they did not notice
when sewn on the frock.</p>

<p>I have made buttons and buckles
galore from old oddments, using up
different coloured beads in an inlaid
fashion.</p>

<p>A most effective way is to cover
the surface of a button with a thin
layer of glue, and to lay the beads
on in a design like a mosaic. This
is a really beautiful way of decorating
buttons, and a very pretty
opaque look can be given by sprinkling
the beads, while the gum is
still wet, with a little of the flitter
used in pen painting.</p>


<p class='sub'>Various Ways of
Using Beads.</p>

<p>A very pretty way of using beads
also is to hem a skirt with them,
simply tacking the hem in the
desired depth, and then, with a long
cotton and needle, make a stitch
through to the right side, slip on a
bead, pass the needle through to
the wrong side, take a long stitch
underneath, and come up on the
right side for a bead again. This
is a most effective way of finishing
a hem, and has the advantage of
being much quicker done than ordinary
hemming. I feel sure that,
once having tried this way, you will
confess it is very much prettier
than an ordinary hem.</p>

<p>Tops of tassels can be made to
match buttons and bead chain in
the exact manner that the sealing-wax
beads are made themselves.</p>

<p>If a whole set, consisting of
chain, buttons, tassel-tops, belt and
shoe-buckles, are made to match,
you have no idea how lovely they
look; and also what a very “Parisian”
look it gives to an otherwise
plain and rather ordinary frock.</p>

<p>Of course, if you are very industrious,
and would like to complete
your outfit, I would suggest knitting
one of the ever-popular bead-bags.</p>

<p>For this all that is necessary is
a ball or two (according to the size
of the bag) of coloured knitting
silk, and a bunch of small beads,
either the same or a contrasting
shade. For instance, a golden
brown silk, with tiny yellow beads,
would look beautiful, especially
were it lined with a daffodil lining,
and finished off at the end with a
bead tassel made to match.</p>

<p>To make these bags you want, as
I say, one ball of brown silk, and
one bunch of tiny yellow beads, and
a pair of fine knitting-needles
especially made for this work, and
which are about as thick as a hat-pin.</p>

<p>To begin with, thread a needle (a
bead needle or darner is best) with
the end of your ball of silk, then
pull out one little strand of beads
and run the needle, darning fashion,
into the thread on which the beads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
themselves are strung. Pull your
silk out of the needle, leaving a
tiny piece over where the silk and
cotton are entwined. Slip the beads
along, and you will find they go
easily over the joined silk, and so
pass, as it were, <i>en masse</i> on to the
knitting silk.</p>

<p>According to the size of the purse
or bag, whichever you desire to
make, so cast on sufficient stitches
for one side only, the bag being
knitted quite flat, and sewn up the
sides when finished.</p>

<p>Having cast on your stitches, knit
one row plain and then one row in
this manner—</p>

<p>Slip your needle into a stitch;
push up a bead; knit the stitch, and
so on to the end of the line.</p>

<p>Next row knit plain silk with no
beads, as the beads are only wanted
one side.</p>

<p>If you do this for about eight
inches, for a small bag, and then
halve it and sew it up, you can then
mount it on a piece of brown silk
to make it deeper.</p>

<p>Personally, I think they look
much prettier when knitted on four
needles; and a very pretty purse I
made I knitted first of all to a depth
of three inches in plain silk, and
then four inches with the beads.</p>

<p>As I came to the bottom I narrowed
off as for the toe of a sock,
finishing to a point. This point I
finished with a tassel of brown and
yellow beads which matched the bag
itself. With a crochet-hook, I made
a tiny edge at the head of the bag,
through which I passed a draw
string of silk in ordinary chain-stitch,
finished at each end with a
tiny tassel.</p>

<div class="caption">A BLACK SILK BAG WITH WHITE BEADS.</div>
</div>

<p class='sub'>A Crochet Bag
Embroidered in
Cross-Stitch.</p>

<p>Ecru “Star
Sylko,” No. 8, with
No. 5 in green and
purple for the
cross-stitch embroidery
were used
in making this
lovely bag. A pair
of ring handles,
dark green, give a
nice finish.</p>

<p>Commence with

<p>Continue on in
this way, increasing
the number of
stitches before the

are 182 stitches
around, then work
72 rounds more.</p>

<p>Finish the end of the bag with a
tassel made of the combined threads.
Line the bag in the usual way with
light color silk.</p>


<p class='sub'>A Black Silk Bag
Beaded in White.</p>

<p>This bag is very easily made and
requires only one ounce of white
porcelain beads with a ball of No. 12
black “Star Sylko.” Cut out the bag
to the required size and use the
corners of the silk left over to form
the four vandyke points. Turn a
narrow hem at each side and the top
of each point, tack in place. Sew
the beads at each side of the point
with a very fine needle and the “Star
Sylko,” each bead is put on with a
“top-stitch,” going through the
centre of the hem. When the four
points are worked, sew up the sides
and bottom of the bag with a French
seam, and turning out the right side
crease the edge all round and tack it,
then sew on the beads as in the
points, around the seam. Make a
crease around the top of the bag, one
and a half inches from the top edge.
Tack the points to this crease, one
on the centre front and another on
the centre back, then one at each
side, all with edges overlapping.
Now sew the points to the bag
with the top-stitch and bead as
before.</p>

<p>Make the lining to fit the bag, turn
in both top edges and tack in place
with the lining edge even with the
edge of the bag, top-sew with the
beads to join them.</p>

<p>Make a line of running stitches
about the quarter of an inch above
to top of the points to make the slot
for the tie-strings. Turn the bag
inside out and sew the lining to the
silk front along the line of beads at
the top of the points.</p>

<p>Now work a buttonhole at each
side of the slot through which the
narrow black riband is run, one from
each side. Make a small loop of the
riband and sew below each buttonhole
for the purpose of pulling the
bag open when closed.</p>


<p class='sub'>The Beaded Tassels.</p>

<p>With the No. 12 “Star Sylko” make
5 ch into a ring, 6 dc into the ring,
then 2 dc into each dc for two
rounds, draw the thread through the
last loop and, leaving about a yard
of it attached, cut it. Run the end
of the thread through the eye of the
fine needle and thread 24 beads, sew
this into a loop to next dc, and
repeat into every 2nd dc. Fasten a
thread on the wrong side of the disc
and bring it up through the centre
ring, thread five beads, sew to a
point and bring the thread back
again through the beads, fastening
off underneath the disc.</p>

<h2>A Violet Handkerchief Sachet.</h2>


<p>There are often small pieces of canvas
left over after a piece of work is
finished that are too good to throw
away (especially considering the present
price of canvas) and yet do not
seem large enough to make even a
tray cloth.</p>

<p>The little handkerchief sachet
shown here suggests one way in
which such a piece may be used. The
bit of canvas employed measured 12
inches by 8 inches, but two pieces
half that size would do, joined to
form the two sides of the sachet.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 308px;">
<img src="images/i117.jpg" width="308" height="360" alt="pretty sachet with ribbons on the right and embroidered leaves and flowers scattered on the face" />
<div class="caption">Only a small quantity of canvas is required for this Sachet.</div>
</div>

<p>Single violets and leaves are worked
in cross-stitch and dotted about over
the sachet. “Tenax” Embroidery
Thread was
used in pretty
shades of violet and
green, with one
stitch of yellow in
the centre of each
open flower, each
stitch being taken
over two threads of
the canvas. White
silk was used to
line the sachet, but
if you have a bit of
pale primrose or
pale heliotrope,
this would do
equally well, and
go beautifully with
the colour of the
violets. The edge
is finished with a
fine cord, and narrow
violet ribbon
is used to tie the
sachet.</p>

<p>Diagrams are given here for working
the nine little designs used on
the handkerchief sachet, each blackened
square representing a cross-stitch
on the canvas. Or you could,
if you preferred, work little rosebuds
and leaves, or daisies, instead of the
violets.</p>

<p>One often wants to make something
for a Sale of Work that does not
involve too much outlay of time or
money. Little sachets of this kind
would be just the thing, and would
probably find a ready sale. Moreover,
they do not entail a great deal of
work, which is a big consideration
in these busy days.</p>

<p>The arrangement of
the flowers on the sachet
need not, of course, be
strictly adhered to. The
little buds and blossoms
lend themselves to almost
any form of treatment.
Just two or three of the
violets may be used, repeating
as desired.</p>

<p>One may be placed at
each corner and one in
the middle, or they may
be arranged in a straight
or diagonal strip. The latter
would be very pretty.</p>

<h2>A Rosebud Handkerchief Box.</h2>


<p>Pretty boxes have a
fascination for most
girls. For handkerchiefs,
gloves, and the
ever-accumulating
stock of collars and
ribbons, there is no
receptacle quite so
handy as a box, and, of
course, it should be
pretty.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 301px;">
<img src="images/i119.jpg" width="301" height="227" alt="box with floral cross-stitch decorations" />
<div class="caption">A Cross-stitch Design is worked on each side of the Box.</div>
</div>
<p>These are expensive
to buy, however, and
therefore the girl who
wants one at little or
no cost must make it
herself. Moreover, the
one you buy is not the <i>only</i> one of its
kind, whereas the one you make
can be.</p>

<p>The rose-box here illustrated has a
little cross-stitch pattern worked on
every side, and on the lid. This
gives a very pretty and original
effect. The designs are worked in
pink and green “Star Sylko” on
white Hardanger canvas, and the
box is lined with pale blue.</p>

<p>To make this box, four pieces of
thin cardboard 7 inches by 5½ inches
are required for the lid and bottom
of the box, four pieces 7 inches by
2½ inches for the sides, and four
pieces 5½ inches by 2½ inches for the
ends. In each case one piece of
cardboard is covered with the lining
material, and one piece with the
canvas, both of which are cut a little
larger than the cardboard. In the
case of the canvas the cross-stitch
design is, of course, worked on
before the cardboard is covered.</p>

<p>Having covered all the pieces,
proceed to sew them together in
pairs—a canvas-covered piece to a
lining-covered piece. Then seam the
double pieces together to make up
the box. This wants to be done
carefully to be quite secure, and, at
the same time, neat.</p>

<p>Before attaching the lid, the seams
and edges are finished off. In the
box illustrated this was done with
No. 3 white “Star Sylko,” using
three strands, and couching down at
intervals with white cotton. This is
continued down the corners of the
box, and completely covers the
seams.</p>

<p>The lid is next attached to the
back of the top edge with over-sewing,
which must be neat and yet
strong. Finally, the lid is edged
with No. 3 “Star Sylko” in the same
way as the box, making a little loop
at each corner, and a knot and ends
at the back.</p>

<p>Diagrams for working the rosebud
cross-stitch designs are given, though
some other flower can be worked if
preferred.</p>

<p>White canvas, as shown, gives a
pretty, delicate effect, but, of course,
this soils very quickly, and for a
more serviceable box it would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
better to use a colour.
Pale blue or pink
would be delightful,
or the shades can be
chosen to follow the
colour scheme of the
room. If a plain
material is used, of
which it is not easy
to count the threads,
the cross-stitch can
be worked over Penelope canvas.</p>

<div class="caption">A DIAGRAM FOR THE DESIGN AT
THE END OF THE BOX.</div>
</div>

<p>Again, if time is limited, it is not
actually necessary to work the
cross-stitch designs. Some figured
material, such as brocade, can be
used, or anything that you happen
to have by you; but a thin material
should not be employed, or it will
tear away when you come to join the
pieces together.</p>

<p>A particular attraction about this
box is that it costs practically nothing.
The outside was made from those odd
pieces of white canvas which every
girl has, and which are too small for
the smallest cloth. The
lining was of pieces left
over from making a
summer dressing-gown.
The cardboard was from
a collection of old boxes
and other odd bits carefully
saved, and the
quantity of ‘Star Sylko,’
from balls already possessed,
was very slight.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
